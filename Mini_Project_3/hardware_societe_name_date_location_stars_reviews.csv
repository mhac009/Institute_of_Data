1,Katerina K.,1/20/2020,"Foster City, CA",4 star rating,"Cute place  for breakfast or brunch.Note 1: the corner table outside might get a wif of the garbage cans around the corner, depending on wind direction. Note 2: there is another  place with 'Hardware' in the name. Make sure you're in the e right one  (we missed the first time). Coffe super tasty! Grilled mushroooms and Crab Benedict awesome too. Additional plus is butter and jams on all the tables  to finish up your meal with."
2,David L.,10/29/2019,"Garden Grove, CA",3 star rating,"We came here at about 11:30am on Wednesday and was quickly seated. This place was recommended by several people. It had a very hip vibe and the decor mirrored the vibe. We ordered the lobster benedict, iced latte and green tea latte. Lobster benedict - The flavors went well with each other and the bun dipped in the oozing egg yolk was delicious. I did feel like it was a little short on the lobster since I forgot it was a lobster benedict until I had a bite of the lobster after eating almost half of it.Green Tea Latte - this drink was good. The foam really tasted like matcha while the latte itself was semi sweet. Iced latte - nothing special above your average iced latte. It was good."
3,Leah M.,12/28/2018,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Quite possibly the best breakfast I've ever had in the city of Melbourne! Tucked away on Hardware Lane you may have to wait a little while to get a table here. Definitely sit outside if the weather permits as you can do some people watching. The coffee here is wonderful so make sure to grab and cup while you peruse the extensive menu available to you! I ordered the Pork Belly and my friend had the Baked Eggs with Chorizo and omigod we died and went to heaven! Highly recommend the Baked Eggs in particular, so much flavor and very filling!Try and make a stop here if you have the chance!"
4,Zeny M.,6/20/2019,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Walked 25 minutes to have breakfast here and got there with the long line up. They took our names and asked to wait on the other side of the street so we won't get wet. It started to rain but got in pretty fast. Got a compliment for the Raptors hats my hubby and son wearing. All the waiters are Raptors fan in Melbourne!  Wow!  Well, we ordered our breakfast and they were just beautifully plated. Quite expensive but worth it. We had the pork belly breakfast $26, lobster Benedict $26, plate of bread with preserves, seared tuna and cappuccino. Truly enjoyable!Highly recommended!"
5,Khaled A.,4/07/2018,"Broomfield, CO",5 star rating,"I'm giving this place a full score due to both restaurant presentation of their food and the taste!!!!First the long black was really good even though I usually find all black coffees taste the same, but here it was different, good different.Next the lobster benedict was amazing! The bun, the hollandaise and the eggs were all greatly combined together.The mocha was also good but from the reviews I read thought it would be better."
6,Stephen H.,12/19/2019,"Paris, France",4 star rating,"This is the original location of the branch in Paris I have come to know and enjoy.  I decided to try something different from what I would normally see in Paris and got the ""Roasted Mushrooms"" (which had roasted mushrooms, poached eggs, toast, goat cheese and hazelnuts and some drizzled pesto) and it ended up being a bit like dinner for breakfast.  Some heavy, earthy flavors that somewhat successfully worked together but might benefit from some editing.  It's a really wonderful space with an open kitchen right next to the large communal table.  They also have excellent coffee."
7,David F.,1/14/2020,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",4 star rating,"The fact that the manager was Irish in no way influenced my very positive view of Hardware Societe. No way. Came here on a warm Wednesday morning for brunch. Tiny place, long communal table, plenty of young people both locals and visitors like us. We were seated after a very short wait. My female companions shared French toast and I opted for the croque Madame. Both excellent and enough to feed 4 people to be honest. Iced lattes and regular lattes were also excellent. Recommended."
8,Hirari H.,1/08/2020,"San Ramon, CA",5 star rating,"This place is rated as the best brunch place on many tourist guides, so I gave it a shot. I ordered what it's known for: the lobster benedict. Oh yes, it was so soft and fresh but also..so cold. Would order again? ...Maybe not. There actually were a lot of other options I was tempted to get instead of the benedict, but given the short amount of time I was in town I just went with the standard. I also absolutely loved the green tea latte. It's very strong for the matcha lovers. There's always a long line, so plan ahead!"
9,Ashlyn H.,1/31/2020,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5 star rating,"Always love a good cup of coffee, with my usual baked eggs with chorizo! But today, I decided to try the roasted mushrooms and it was amazing !"
10,Barb M.,1/21/2020,"Glenlee, Australia",5 star rating,"An amazing place for breakfast!  I had the bircher and a flat white. Unbelievably good. So delicious and fresh. Light, creamy and not at all heavy. The coffee comes with a little donut bite which was fresh and a perfect taste. Best coffee I've had in Melbourne this visit. The service was brilliant, so friendly and happy. Very engaging and pleasant. A lovely atmosphere. Busy but not overly loud. Will recommend and be back for sure!"
11,Sean C.,8/10/2019,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"This place is really busy.  There's a long, community table that probably won't work well for large parties.  Tried the popular lobster benedict, which is actually an eggs benedict between two black brioche buns.  The top of the black bun is buttered and the bun itself is pretty good. The lobster was decent, and then eggs were cooked to perfection.  The brioche was alright and it came with french jam, Bonne Maman (which happens ot be available all over the U.S.).  Classic American/british rock hits playing in the background like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Boston, etc contributed to the laid back ambience. Credit card has extra charge (similar to a lot of other places in the Melbourne).  Service is fast and friendly.  Seems to be a popular tourist destination."
12,Val M.,1/01/2019,"Johns Island, SC",5 star rating,"Great place! You literally can pick anything on the menu and you can't go wrong. Capuchino and double whites are delicious. In USA double whites are not widely available, so I would always get extra cup :) love it:)The place is small and very popular,  so you might will have to wait for a little while, but it all worth it. The atmosphere is very cool and staff is very friendly.  All dishes were very fresh and super tasty, and food presentation was awesome. Recommend it!Cheers :)"
13,Courtney M.,2/03/2020,"Mountain View, CA",5 star rating,"This is an amazing restaurant for brunch! It's a popular restaurant, especially on the weekends, so getting there before 9:30am will help you get a table faster. I arrived at about 10am and only waited about 20 minutes though. Since they were busy they were very accommodating and figured out a way to make space for me, especially given that I had an injury and couldn't walk very far, which I really appreciated. Their food is absolutely amazing; the ambiance is fun and welcoming. Their chai tea latte with oat milk was the best chai I had in all of Melbourne while I was visiting. Thanks for a wonderful experience!"
14,Tiffany C.,8/25/2018,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,"I've heard so many things about Hardware Society that it became one of the first places on my must try list when I arrived at Melbourne. Unfortunately, perhaps it was a bit too hyped for me, this place is actually not on my top places for brunch.Baked Eggs - The flavours were there and the entire dish tasted tangy from the tomatoes yet mild and well blended. That being said, I might have misheard the waitress but because I thought she said to not mix the egg, it started to harden and I ended up not having the nice gooeyness that would've made the dish perfect. Perhaps I am a bit biased in that sense, but I didn't think it would deserve that price. One other thing was that my bread was a tad too hard and over toasted, so it was hard for my mom to bite into even when dipped in the dish. Tuna Millefeuille - when I went they had the tuna rather than salmon mille feuille. Being a foodie that loves pastries, I decided to give it a shot. Overall light and tuna taste was evident and fresh. That being said, I don't think I necessarily enjoyed the texture of the tuna. Again it was pleasant but not necessarily amazing.Scrambled eggs - their eggs were runny and creamy, just the way I like my eggs. full of flavours and you can taste each note described on their menu. This was my favorite dish for sure.Overall I would love to go back to Hardware Société as it's such a popular place. The prices are steep though so I won't go regularly, but they change their menus from time to time and have weekend specials. You can never have too much brunch here in Melbourne!"
15,Pearce D.,6/17/2017,"Hoboken, NJ",5 star rating,"There's a lot of hype for this place but with good reason. I've never ordered multiple meals as a solo diner just to sample different things, but I was tempted to do so here. But like most others, I defaulted to the baked eggs. Definitely did not disappoint, though the only negative was that it did take quite a while. There's going to be a line, but it moves exceptionally quick. Just go. You won't regret it."
16,Lee R.,2/21/2020,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,The decor and food presentation is gorgeous and service is excellent but none of us loved our meals and it was expensive. My husband did not enjoy the vegetarian baked eggs. He felt it tasted bland. My daughter did not love her eggs with smoked salmon.  It looked a lot better than it tasted. I had the Bircher which was tasty but much too sweet for a meal. It would have been delicious if it was for dessert.
17,Hansel B.,4/14/2017,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Breakfast/Brunch - doesn't matter what you want, this place has you covered.I recommend the Baked Eggs Deux, they have a few other baked egg options that will hit the spot.The place can get quite packed, but it's a short wait if you are a small group."
18,Bellinda K.,2/01/2020,"Serangoon, Singapore, Singapore",5 star rating,Yummy! Always yummy and the staffs are super lovely! Been here for a couple of timeS!
19,Yi Z.,11/13/2016,"Berkeley, CA",5 star rating,"The Hardware Societe is around the corner from where we were staying. I had heard that Melbourne has a reputation for brunch, just like SF, where I live. We got to The Hardware Societe at 8:30am on Friday morning and the place was buzzing with activity. Luckily, we did not have to wait at all to get seated. I had studied the photos in advance and had a good idea of what the popular dishes were. When I got to there and started looking around at other people's meals, everything looked so delicious and it made the choice extremely difficult. My friend ordered the Baked Eggs Deux (with Chorizo) that everyone raves about. It was served with a few pieces of a baguette. It looked so yummy and he enjoyed it very much.After conferring with the server, I settled on the Pork Belly dish. It came with two eggs, sunny side up, jamon, potato cakes, and pork belly. The presentation was a feast for the eyes. The sauces that were on the plate were perfect complements to the dish. The funny thing is that my least favorite portion of the dish was the pork belly. The egg and everything else were spectacular. I also had a the famous thick hot chocolate, which was served with a mini donut. I was stuffed and extremely happy with our breakfast choice."
20,Chris W.,12/28/2019,"Lucas, Australia",5 star rating,Great spot for a bite of brunch and amazing coffee. Always seems busy but well worth the wait!
21,Jennifer K.,12/19/2016,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"If you are into Brunch, You should not miss eating at The Hardware Societe! We arrived on a weekday before the lunch rush and there was no wait for a table for 2. Menu selection is really good and of course it took us awhile to decide on what to order. Our waiter was really friendly and gave us several recommendation.We shared:Baked Eggs Deux ($18) Seared Scallops and Tuna Millefeuille ($26)Matcha Maiden Green Tea Latte ($5)Artisanale Limonade by Hansi ($4.50)The Baked Eggs with Chorizo was just so good and comforting! Love all the components in the dish! But that Seared Scallops dish probably one of the best brunch food I ever ate! I love the scallops and the tartness of the tartar from apple and yuzu alioli. The menu has so many choices includes wagyu beef, pork belly, duck confit and even lobster! And there is always quite a few vegetarian options.I still dream about having Scallops and Tuna for brunch..............."
22,Karl H.,8/21/2018,"Huntingtown, MD",5 star rating,"We wanted to go for a while and finally got in on the weekend this winter...  It was raining (see photo). We Put our name on the list for a 25 minute wait.  No one left the queue, but it was well managed and moved along. Once inside service was friendly,  prompt and attentive,  the whole place was pleasant. Hot drinks were fast and rich. Hot chocolate here was top 3 I've had in the state- Mork was #1.The food (breakfast) was savory,  top quality,  well prepared and beautiful. We ordered a second course late to share. I'd wait in the winter rain again for this one."
23,V C.,9/21/2017,"Cupertino, CA",5 star rating,"The Hardware Societe is wonderful! In Melbourne cafe scene, their popularity is second to none and no matter which day of the week, you would always see lines. It actually took me 3 trials to finally score a seat in this place. Located inside the iconic Hardware Lane, this petite cafe offers a different vibe that I instantly fall in love with; rustic decor combined with colorful butterfly wallpapers - pretty! Also, this isn't exactly a quiet or peaceful cafe... instead the inside is somewhat chaotic and the energy is on!! The food selections here are mainly Australian - French inspired breakfast and brunch menu, quite adventurous and their food will pamper all your senses. * The baked egg w/ chorizo ($19): what they are famous for and it doesn't disappoint. The baked egg consists of chorizo, potatoes, egg and sprinkle with almonds. Taste-wise, it was absolutely delicious, flavorful and melt in your mouth. Served with few pieces of toasted baguette on the side, which goes beautifully with the fluffy egg texture - addicting!* Matcha latte: I love everything matcha, but I was kinda disappointed with this one.  The latte was very grainy and a tad watery, but I do like the fact that it was not overly sweet. * Mork hot chocolate: Rich and delightful, presentation was unique, as it was served with chunks of melted chocolate inside and stirred it with warm milk. * Pork belly and fried eggs ($25): I'm loving this one. A breakfast combo that never fails! Consisting two mashed potato croquettes, a thick slab of crunchy pork belly (tender and fatty but in proper amount) and over easy fried egg on top of toasted bread - Definitely a go! In all, The Hardware Societe is a culinary gem, the food was worth the hype and the effort to get here. One of my fave cafe in the city!!"
24,Sarah M.,10/04/2019,"Sydney, Australia",5 star rating,If you want breakfast with a twist and that will satisfy you for your trek around Melbourne this is the place to goWhen I visit Melbourne this is my daily breakfast joint everywhere else is a waste of money and I'm missing out because I should be eating at Hardware Société !The baked eggs with chorizo is a must served sizzling with sourdough soldiers only thing I suggest is as for a separate plate as it's easier to eatThe pork belly with eggs is sensuous crunchy crackling served with heavenly croquettes watercress and the most insane hollandaise sauce yum!!! Their signature lobster on black brioche is divine!!!! in fact the only issue is every time you come here you'll get FOMO and need to come back the next day and order what your partner had!!! I'm going back today for the croque madame and the new lavender bavarois
25,John B.,3/01/2017,"Fayetteville, NC",4 star rating,"This prominent and well-attended alleyway brunch cafe offered a menu in French. It took me way too long to realize that the English translation was on the opposing page, so heads up on that.Their options were predictably somewhat of a struggle from my vegetarian perspective, but I nonetheless found happiness with their fried brioche, a fluffy creation with an appealing ensemble of fruits. The setting was what I take to be archetypically Melburnian; a quasi-European cafe in a alley used as a pedestrian thoroughfare. I'd go back."
26,Kel P.,1/17/2016,"London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"There's a reason why there's a constant queue (and it's a long one) out this shop! The food is great, the coffee is great, the setting is great!You basically cannot go wrong to visit this joint if you are a foodie! While the setting is no first date romantic, it is a trendy place where you can get a nice setting with great food!The food there is generally more fusion, where you get interesting combinations and overall it's just pure brilliance! I reckon just looking at he menu and discussing what they are is already a fun game!Food as expected is great, so I won't discuss much here. Go experience it yourself!Note, it is not exactly cheap, and yes you better get there early to avoid the minimum 1 hr queue."
27,Angelica C.,12/29/2017,"Santa Monica, CA",4 star rating,"My sister and I got to sit up on the counter which usually I wouldn't enjoy but in this case it was a lot of fun. We got to watch and enjoy all the action in the kitchen of the cooks preparing all the plates. It was pretty enjoyable. Although there was a line, it moved pretty quickly. We ordered this chorizo egg dish which was our favorite, a peach yogurt item (don't order), and the lobster Benedict (which was okay). We also got the matcha latte and hot chocolate both of which were really good and definitely would go back just for the hot chocolate. I thought there was so much hype to this place and I was a little let down. The presentation was great but wish I enjoyed more of the stuff we ordered. Overall if you come here, get the hot chocolate and egg with chorizo dish."
28,Allen T.,12/04/2017,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Tucked in the back of a little alleyway is this fantastic cafe. We must have showed up an exactly the right time because we were seated immediately.  (The place was full when we arrived and a long line had formed by the time we left). To start, I ordered a soy flat white which absolutely perfect - it was so good that I ordered a second! I had the lobster Benedict which was one of the best benedicts I've ever had. The egg had a beautiful runny golden yolks which mixed with the lobster and the squid ink brioche bun perfectly. The service was friendly and efficient and the food and coffee were excellent."
29,Shirley M.,3/02/2019,"Piscataway Township, NJ",5 star rating,Sat at the bar as I was a party of one. Not too terrible of a wait. Great vibes!!! As others have recommended ordered the Duex (baked eggs with Chorizo) and got the flat white. Yum!!
30,Mark C.,11/27/2017,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"I had a counter seat and witnessed the kitchen staff pumping out one beautiful dish after another.The lobster benedict is the best benedict dish I've had anywhere. The lobster salad is packed with dill and parsley, a winning combination that would make Northern Germans drool. The hollandaise is really, really special."
31,Kim G.,9/29/2019,"Canberra, Australia",4 star rating,"Went to this place back in February 2018,  remembered how much I loved it when I saw it pop up just now. The breakfast was fantastic,  the service was really good, can highly recommend. Seating may be be a little bit of a challenge when it's busy so would recommend getting there pretty early especially on the weekend. All in all a great cafe with amazing food and delightful service, it's a Melbourne institution definitely don't miss if you're travelling through. Not cheap but definitely represents value for money."
32,Thomas L.,11/13/2017,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"French style cafe in the alley!Continuing Melbourne's creative uses of laneways, this place is located down one of them - just look for the rooster statue out front. We came by on a Tues morning and inside was full already. We opted for an outside table and the server was kind of enough to turn on the external heater for us.We ordered the baked eggs uno and the poached eggs with roasted mushrooms. The baked eggs seemed unique as they come in a cast iron pot topped with scallops and crisp ham while there is a side of bread drizzled with basil oil. Be careful as it very hot! Scallops were sweet and paired with the salty ham and eggs. Bread is awesome for sopping up the runny eggs. The poached eggs were great as the mushrooms were nicely roasted. We also ordered a croissant to try - big and fluffy with crisp outside and soft insideOverall, loved the food, service and atmosphere. We will definitely come back to try more."
33,Anna V.,1/26/2019,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"We just had breakfast here and we really enjoyed the food. Good thing we arrived before 8am (it opens at 8am). By the time we finished at 8:50am it was packed and there was a lineup with probably 10-20 people waiting in that line. I had their special of the day, a smoked salmon with salmon in a puff pastry and two poached eggs with corn syrup (in lieu of hollandaise). Portion was a very good size and food was great! Loved the presentation. My husband had the pork belly with fried eggs (two eggs sunny side up). They did the pork belly really well with a very crispy skin. We also had a cappuccino and a black brewed coffee. Cup sizes are smaller than North America! Not a dairy-free and egg-free friendly place if you have those allergies, which my daughter does. We got her some sourdough toast with jam as that was the only thing she could eat. Nice little restaurant down a nice little lanwith character and a nice little patio for seating outside if you prefer."
34,Jennifer R.,1/06/2018,"Whittier, CA",5 star rating,"This place is exceptional in all aspects. It is a quaint place with excellent food and service. When we arrived there was a line but it was a very short wait. We were lucky enough to eat at the bar we were able to watch the kitchen staff make picture perfect plates one right another. They operated like a well oiled machine. We had the special Brioche Toast and Pork Belly & Eggs w/Martha Maiden Green Maiden Green Tea Latte and House made Ice Tea.  Everything was delicious.  My favorite was the latte made with/matcha, ice cream, milk and a spoonful of honey. Amazing. The Brioche Toast w/mascarpone, peaches and marcona almonds was a perfect blend of flavors. The Pork Belly & Eggs was also fantastic. The only disappointment was that I was not able to sample every dish. I plan on returning before we leave Melbourne."
35,Emma S.,1/23/2019,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"Weekday brunch here whilst in Melb for Aus Open.Very busy at around 930am; we were lucky we got one of the last tables before a line formed.Staff polite and attentive. Had a problem with printer so food took significantly longer than expected... our order was not processed and food took about 30 mins.. however waitress apologized and food came quickly after error noted.Meals are very generous. We had mushrooms and eggs and continental breakfast. Good options for vegetarians and food was delish! Eggs cooked perfectly, croissant was just right and coffee was also well made. I had a great oat milk flat white which is hard to come by!"
36,Lauren E.,9/15/2018,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Had been to Hardware Societe on a previous trip to Melbourne so I when I came back, I knew this was a must go..and actually did 3 times during the week.  The food is really good and the atmosphere is charming.  Teapots are covered in crocheted warmers and the teacups are super cute.  Over the course of the 3 visits, my colleague and I had Porridge with pears and cinnamon butter - love the cinnamon butter addition and will be replicating that for my oatsBaked eggs with chorizo - super good! Probably their most popular dish. Ratatouille with burrata and poached eggsPumpkin and roasted mushrooms - good, but I feel like there are way too many mushrooms Lobster Benedict - could have had more lobster but was yummy Croque Madame - best food item we had! Love the leeks on the bottom.  It's bread heavy, but the bread is thick and soft. Earl gray tea - amazingCold chocolate - okThe reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is because they don't customize meaning that they wouldn't leave something out of the dish."
37,Bob M.,11/10/2018,"Hobart, Australia",5 star rating,"Awesome place, on holidays went to this cafe for breakfast. Food was unique and super yum. Highly recommend if you are looking for a breakfast out of the box."
38,Loli L.,2/05/2018,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"The thing I love about Melbourne is the food. Is it a long-ass flight to get here? Yes. But they more than make up for it with all the good food. People in this lovely city have certain expectations when it comes to food, and the food shows it.We subjected our offspring to a rather long morning walk to get here but he happily ate not only his food, but some of mine as well :( To be fair, I also partook in his vanilla yogurt and muesli. Enjoyed a lovely sparkling wine with the parts of my brunch that weren't commandeered by the child. Left beyond recharged for the rest of the day.If you like food that is not only beautiful but delicious, then don't come here, because I don't like waiting more than I have to in the morning.Friendly service, great food, and very nice butterfly wallpaper.One more quick thing. I'm a big mimosa drinker. Often, when I'm having a great time in Australia, I'll forget I'm not in America and order a mimosa. (My bad!) Our server very graciously brought out a little thing of orange juice and small bottle of sparkling wine and apologized that I would have to fix it myself. I was more embarrassed that I'd forgotten where I was and that I put our server through some fuss. I sincerely appreciated the trouble they went through for my off-menu request. They totally didn't have to but this just forever cemented their place in my heart.  (I ended up making half a mimosa, and then drank the rest of the sparkling wine straight. The wine here is lovely!)"
39,Beth C.,7/26/2019,"Hocking, Australia",5 star rating,"Recommend 100% very cosy French themed cafe! Coffee is delicious too.My friend ordered a GF dish, as the waiter brought it over, he noticed it wasn't GF, so he got it changed for her, very good  customer service, thank you!"
40,Allie M.,6/15/2018,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"My favorite bar in Melbourne.I eat here every week. This is an amazing place with cool interior design and pleasant atmosphere. Rustic decor combined with colorful butterfly wallpapers - pretty! Great place for breakfast. Go for the mixed Pork Belly & Fried Eggs. Consisting of two potatoes croquettes, a thick plate of crunchy pork belly and over a fried egg on top of toasted bread. It is so tasty!! The latte was very grainy and a tad watery, but I do like the fact that it was not overly sweet. It is a good solution for my good day."
41,David S.,1/04/2017,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"Imagine my surprise when I sat down at the table in this restaurant to discover that the menu was in French. Actually, it really surprised me because the one thing that I did not expect to see in Australia was a menu in another language. Okay, for those of use that can't speak, or read, French they do have the English on the facing page, but I have to admit that it was pretty awesome, especially since I do know a little French. Mind you, don't try ordering in French because from what I gathered speaking French is not a requirement to work at this cafe. Anyway it is hugely popular, especially at lunch because there is always, without fail, a waiting list. In fact that is also the case in the morning, but I suspect that has a lot to do with it's classy, French atmosphere."
42,Grace M.,10/15/2016,"North Adams, MA",4 star rating,"Cutesy place but very busy. There's always a line, mostly tourists I gather. But nevertheless my brunch was cooked very well. I got the fried brioche which is their delicious version of French toast. It was nicely caramelized on the outside so it cracked like a crème brûlée but it was soft and tender on the inside. My companion got one of the cheesy eggs -- too cheesy for me. I like eggs but this dish was mostly cheese (which I also like but was just not what we were expecting). We also got the mochas which was DIY. We got espresso shots and separate bowls of warm chocolate to pour into the coffee, so you have control over the sweetness of your coffee. Would I go back? Probly not. There are just as good places with less of a line."
43,Tai W.,9/16/2016,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,Like every other nice restaurant in Melbourne this is in a random alley way. So keep your eyes peeled.The baked eggs with chorizo are AMAZING!! Cheesy and so flavorful.If you get the hot chocolate like me make sure you stir the pot as well. Apparently all the chocolate is on the bottom...
44,Nickey L.,4/18/2017,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Waited on line about 30 minutes (party of 5) around lunch time. This place seemed pretty hyped up. With a modern/artsy interior design, it was a cozy little spot. I got the sweet French toast special with green tea panna cotta. It was very light and delicious. A few friends had the pork belly, and I enjoyed stealing bites of that. I had their flat white, apparently a must have coffee. It was pretty good. Overall a solid choice if you are in the area, not too sure if I would wait in the line again though."
45,Vanessa B.,3/29/2016,"Perth, Australia",3 star rating,"Contemplating one morning where to go for breakfast and it being a public holiday we thought we'd go here... and pretty much so did everyone else that morning.The line/crowd outside the cafe was insane, but we put our names down and only had to wait around 25 minutes. Which was good considering how many people were there but I guess only being the 2 of us it was easier to sit us than a group of 4.We were seated up near the kitchen, which is where we sat the first time we went as well in 2014. We ordered our coffees and my partner got the special of the day which was a duck tart/pastry with poached eggs and I ordered the pork belly with bacon/potato croquettes and asked them to minus the eggs (I do not eat eggs). We heard them in the kitchen about the order which I thought was a bit rude, but to be honest how hard is it to not have to cook an element, understand they were busy and no modifications can be made but it was simple and of course they delivered.When the food arrived which was pretty quick, our food was just warm.. not hot. Which was a bit disappointing. The pork belly wasn't crispy and was bit cold in the middle. Even the duck tart wasn't hot, I understand they were under the pump but still need to maintain efficiency.The best thing about breakfast was the coffee."
46,Jade M.,1/24/2018,"Wellington, New Zealand",4 star rating,Delightful and pleasant. We got here before it got slammed.  He had baked eggs with chorizo. I had eggs Benedict with pork rillettes. Gentle well-made coffees.  Oh how I do like this place.
47,Michael R.,6/20/2018,"Shibuya, Japan",3 star rating,"3 stars for the Great decor & ambiance. Liked the 2 different theme decor. Variety of food is good. Ordered the Mac & Cheese, Beer Battered fries and cheese Pizza. Taste was ok. Tried the 6 glasses beer taster. Truthfully, the beers are not that good compared to other craft beer I've had."
48,Lachlan C.,1/08/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"One word, wow. I've been here 6 times but this is the first time I've actually managed to get a table and eat here without waiting over an hour. I can see why this place is always busy. Always thought this place couldn't be that good for a 2hr wait but only waited 10 minutes this time which was surprising.Firstly ordered an iced mocha while my dad ordered a cider. The serving size of the cider was tiny for $9 but even the iced mocha which by the way was amazing the serving size was a little small but nevertheless the food was the reason why we came.Service was very good and the ambience was good too seated on the shared marble table was nice which is better than a wooden table anyway.A first glance at the menu and was blown away, salmon milfeulle, lobster brioche roll, Croque Madame. I ordered the salmon milfeulle while my dad got the lobster brioche roll.The salmon millfeulle came with a perfectly cooked seared/pan fried salmon which had beautiful texture and the best thing was no oil!The millfeulle part had the common pastry crust on the top and bottom, texture perfect, crispy yet still can cut with a knife pretty well. The inside had the flavourous avocado puree and the beautiful raw salmon mix. Packed with flavour definitely the best part of the dish.Poached eggs also came with the dish which were poached great and the charred asparagus along with salmon eggs/caviar was a nice touch and add to the vivid flavours in this dish.My dad's lobster brioche roll came with well cooked lobster, poached eggs in a brioche bun and asparagus with it. The lobster was cooked perfect, very juicy and packed with flavour.Overall this is the best brunch place in Melbourne. The inventiveness of the flavours they can put in iconic breakfast dishes along with the great cooking make this the place to beat. No wonder it has been at the top of zomato and yelp for a long time along with the long wait to get in.Will definitely want to come back but depends on the wait of course, not even this place is worth a two hour wait. But still give this the credit it deserves!"
49,Yiming Z.,2/18/2018,"Hilo, HI",4 star rating,"This is the best brunch we have had in Melbourne! Great food and coffee and value for money. Ten minutes wait, but I promise you it's all worth it! We have tried the most popular lobster eggs benedict and baked eggs with scallops."
50,Suzie R.,6/24/2017,"Elwood, Australia",5 star rating,"This Melbourne icon offers a delicious brunch if you don't mind a wait. We visited on a Sunday morning and of course it was packed! My lovely friend arrived early so luckily I only had to wait about 5 minutes, but in total I would say she waited about 30. We sat outside and although we were right by the entrance, I felt removed from the people queuing and the many people walking by. We were served promptly with time taken to explain the menu and specials. Our waiter was friendly but aware of how busy the restaurant was - making time for a chat, but not lingering too long. We were made to feel welcome, but not fussed over; served promptly, but not rushed.I ordered the sweet special: fried brioche, with deconstructed cheesecake and fresh berries. The brioche was wonderful, had a gorgeous flavour and was fried to perfection. I loved the berry combination and the deconstructed cheesecake, but for me there was too much of the yogurt based sauce so this overpowered the dish a little. My friend ordered the roasted mushrooms, which was a generous portion with a lot of flavour. The coffee was delicious, with a smooth flavour.Overall, I found the experience at The Hardware Societe to be very enjoyable, while I wouldn't say it lives up the hype of being the absolute best brunch you will ever eat - it certainly sits up there with the top spots in Melbourne."
51,Karyn J.,6/03/2018,"West Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,It's really hard to get a seat in the main cafe where all the cute and instagrammable decor is. I've been there twice now and was seated outside or in the second dining area across the lane. Food was delicious both times and tea was nice in it's little tea-cosied teapot. Matcha lattes are tiny. Highly recommend the fried brioche (French toast) and baked eggs.
52,Philipp K.,5/25/2018,"Melbourne, Australia",3 star rating,"Too extravagant for me and I didn't like things in the dishes. Couldn't change pork belly to bacon. Guess they don't accept customized orders. Weird for a place who wants to seem extravagant, especially consodering the price.Still very good coffee and friendly staff."
53,Khadija M.,3/29/2018,"Yucaipa, CA",5 star rating,"This was the very first breakfast restaurant I visiting during my spring break and so I kind of went all out. I had the matcha latte with the lobster eggs benny and a warm croissant. The flavors that the lobster eggs benny brought out were absolutely one of the best that I've had; however it could definitely be considered more on the heavy side for a breakfast portion. The matcha was superb, no clumps, just a smooth creamy matcha latte. The croissant was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside which is exactly the way I like it. Overall, I recommend this place for its food and the aesthetics of the seating area."
54,Mary A.,10/23/2016,"Brisbane, Australia",4 star rating,"I met up for breakfast on a Sunday morning on Hardware Lane with a friend at this cute place! We were seated in less than 5 minutes and got our order taken in less than 10 minutes. Our waiter that served us was friendly & upbeat :) My friend's Pork Belly was a hearty serving while my Lobster eggs benedict was of a smaller size - but was not saddening at all as it was still very satisfying and deliciously rich due to the two poached eggs & hollandaise sauce. The lobster was of good mouthful sizes & well flavoured so I believe it was worth the $27.00 since you are paying for a good quality breakfast type meal, + it including lobster. Whoever is the barista of this place needs praise as every coffee(s)/ & matcha lattes I saw come out were all beautifully made! Not only was it so presentable, but it was very smooth to drink, and had good matcha flavour - not the strongest but I might be biased as I do love matcha everything :pI thought it was going to be a bad idea that we were allocated to sit outside due to it looking like it was going to rain, but the place comes with roll out roofing so it was not an issue in the end. Other: Definitely a place to come early to & secure a table for because as we were leaving there were just people scattered waiting around the lane waiting for their names to be called out - felt super lucky with our timing !"
55,Jane K.,3/22/2019,"Bulleen, Australia",1 star rating,Terrible terrible service. I know they are famous. But they can not be that rude service. And they let us seat next rubbish bin. And they said you guys should be alright?   And. Explanation was very poor.   We were asking and considering about menu. Maybe few second    She didnt excuse us. Just said i will give you few min for you guys.    ? What ?   We about order    Morning busy hour.  And. They served half eaten butter   With someones bread pieces
56,Amanda-Jane W.,2/17/2018,"Dunedin, New Zealand",4 star rating,"We went for lunch.  The menu is quite large.  I had baked eggs with scallops and some fruit sourdough toasted.  My friend had the tuna Mille feuille.  I think she won the meal choice (mine was nice, hers was amazing!). It is not a super cheap place but that can be attributed in part to the fact they appear to use high quality ingredients.The staff were awesome.  The only thing that let lunch down was the coffee.  In saying that - I'm sure there's plenty of other good places and I'd not usually want to queue 20mins to get a table!Oh and they do not split bills which was a bit of a pain for us."
57,Tammy L.,4/20/2013,"Sugar Land, TX",5 star rating,"We saved the best cafe of our trip for last, and it most definitely did not disappoint!  Hardware Societe, another laneway cafe in Melbourne on my fooding list, isn't quite a dime a dozen.  From their country-side ambience to its to-the-point yet cordial service - not to mention their food - this place serves up a delicious frenzy!  I have never seen two chefs in Australia working at such top speed...There was quite the line when we arrived at Hardware Societe at around 10am, and though we did wait for a little bit in the chilly weather, the warm, moist banana bread made up for it!  The Banana and Coconut Loaf (15) was probably one of the best - if not the best - banana bread I've ever had, even though I don't like bananas that much.  Now that is saying something.  The bread had whole chunks of caramel banana in it, and although I don't think it added anything to it, it didn't take away either.  The salted caramel marscapone was ""cherry on top,"" moistening the bread further while adding some sweetness - making this dish a perfect 10!  The only downside?  Getting really full after finishing a whole loaf!The Baked Eggs with Chorizo Sausage, Piquillo Pimento Sauce, Crunchy Almonds, and Queso de Cabra Goats Milk Cheese (17) was also delicious.  The dish was nice and steamy, making it a perfect breakfast item for a chilly morning!  The egg was baked and overly well done, which made it the perfect spread texture for the baguette that came with it.  The baguette was also fresh and crunchy, and not at all stale or scratchy - the main reason I typically don't like baguettes.  There are very few dishes I would ever order twice at a cafe - and Harware Societe has successfully created two!  I'd have to say - even I am quite impressed.As for their latte - it wasn't anything outstanding, but the hot chocolate looked even better!  I was slightly envious of Jo's steamy pot of it..."
58,Jakab B.,6/24/2015,"Parkville, Australia",3 star rating,"I had the fried brioche and a French earl grey tea. Both were beautiful and of course, worth the small 10 minute queue (it was, after all, a Thursday afternoon), however I don't believe the quality of the food was worth the price. Further I don't know if it was where I was seated (a cramped circular shared seating arrangement mind you) but the restaurant seems to have a pesky fly problem..? There was a small swarm around where I was eating! All in all, it's a nice place to eat and I would recommend any one to give it a chance if they haven't yet. But bare in mind there are other places for breakfast/brunch within the CBD who deal excellent meals for a portion of HS's prices."
59,Jackie R.,1/29/2016,"Union City, NJ",5 star rating,We had breakfast here two days in a row. It was that great. The first day we had the baked eggs (called deux). It was the one with chorizo in it and it came in a tiny pot straight out of the oven. So delicious. Onthe second day we tried the pork belly with egg dish and it was amazing. Try getting there before 9am or after 1pm otherwise the wait could be up to 40 minutes. We got there at 905 and had a reasonable 15 minute wait. Ten minutes after we got there the line was twice as long. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and I would definitely recommend. Once you're seated your food arrives quickly and the service was great. Well worth the wait. A must try.
60,Rob C.,3/29/2019,"Palo Alto, CA",5 star rating,"4.5 popular brunch spot. had the baked eggs with chorizo, very runny in the center, mix of textures, nice cheese. try the bread with the jams"
61,Davida O.,12/28/2017,"Scottsdale, AZ",5 star rating,We had a great breakfast here. Cute spot in a fun laneway. The menu had a good variety to choose from and what we ate was delicious! Coffee was yummy too! Friendly and great service!
62,Sven D.,9/06/2019,"Rome, Italy",5 star rating,"Took a walk from the Hyatt to this cafe based on the reviews. It was outstanding. Had The Big Breaki, eggs were perfect and the Chorizo was spot on."
63,Henry C.,7/12/2018,"San Bruno, CA",5 star rating,Have a lobster Benedict and baked eggs.  Both are good.  But I would recommended on the baked eggs next time
64,Josh A.,10/12/2017,"Perth, Australia",4 star rating,"Great little place down an alley. However, the soy milk Long Mac I received was split. Asking the waitress for another one was received well, yet the new coffee also proved to be a challenge to the barista and once again arrived split.Enough negativity though, my friend had a regular milk latte that looked perfect and he said the same. The Baked Eggs Duex was fantastic! The almonds really set the dish apart. It was well balanced and full of flavour and the portion size was spot on."
65,Rua A.,10/25/2015,"Auckland, New Zealand",5 star rating,"Fantastic food and great service! We came on a Friday morning so wait was very short and we were seated in a large shared table, we ordered the baked eggs veg version and fried brioche we shared between the two of us, everything was delicious and the coffee was amazing. Highly recommended :) PS we came the next day and it was just as good!"
66,James Y.,10/22/2015,"Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia",5 star rating,YR: F4.5/E4/R4yrscore.comInteresting choices in the food menu. I went for the steam egg with scallop which was well made. The sweetness of the scallop was nicely infused with the egg. Macha latte and latte were well crafted.The interior is well decorated. Gave me the impression of a fairytale land.The queue can be quite long. Will revisit if I am back in this area.
67,Sarina W.,12/09/2017,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"The Hardware Societe must be one of my favourite brekkie spot ever since it first opened.  They changed their delicious menu regularly to tease and tantalise tastebuds.  Not to miss are their ever changing fried brioche, today I had the brioche atopped with poached quince, hazelnut & chocolate spread, roasted hazelnut and pistachio.  This is probably as close as I could get to heaven.  The richness of the hazelcho spread was balanced with the slightly tart honey poached quince and even though I was super full I kept digging into it as it was simply sensational.  Thankfully I also had their lovely licorice, fennel and mint tea to go with this.If I wasn't having the brioche, I'd probably go with the scrambled eggs or the baked eggs.  Once again the flavours changes regularly.  One time the scramble might come with a salmon baguette, the next you might get prawns with it.  I would probably pair this with their hot chocolate... yummmmmIf you are feeling starved, I would highly recommend their croque monsieur.  I am never that famished but did have a taste of my friend's croque monsieur and it was amazzzzzing.The Hardware Societe also has a mini food store section where they sell jams, lollies, baguettes and drinks.  Definitely worth checking it out as well!"
68,Katie G.,4/24/2015,"Denver, CO",5 star rating,"This place is hard to snag a seat in, which means it's good! We sat at a communal table, which was great because we could talk to some of the locals. We tried the lobster Benedict and the pork belly with a chili fried egg. The pork belly was just ok, but the chili fried egg was delicious. The lobster Benedict was also flavored well. Definitely eat breakfast/brunch here. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked delicious"
69,Angie O.,8/15/2017,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"I've been here twice, both times before peak hours so it didn't take long to get a seat. Service was good on both occasions even as they got busier and more packed. The waitresses were attentive and charismatic. I've tried both of their baked eggs with scallops and chorizo and have fallen in love with their mastery of mixing ingredients. The flavors were so distinct and complementary and rich without being over the top. Their fresh garnish on the baked eggs were such a nice touch to bring in all the other flavors. This is a lovely brunch spot to try in the CBD if you've got time. It's very popular so try to come outside peak hours to avoid a queue."
70,Alex R.,11/05/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"Consistently good! Amazing fresh and wholesome produce with a French-Spanish spin on things, The Hardware Societe is an absolute favourite. This is the perfect spot for brunch! It's small and cosy with a counter that's overflowing with croissants, macaroons, cakes and biscuits. We sat outside in the lane, amongst the hustle and bustle of Hardware Lane. We had the Niçoise salad w/ tuna, omelette w/ Spanish potatoes, tomato & Brie cheese and an empanada. The food was delicious and had spot on ideal flavours. The service is fast and friendly and it's always a pleasure eating here!"
71,Samantha W.,7/18/2019,"Gloucester, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"If I could open this joint up in Canada, I 100% would. Friend took me here when I visited Australia and I still dream about the deux ouefs I had there. The dish is pricey but if there was a place where I would pay a pricey amount, it would be here.. and every restaurant in Melbourne. So many good eats and this is definitely one of them!"
72,Teresa H.,6/18/2014,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"A popular hotspot with the long wait.....totally worth it! Great coffee and delicious brunch - I had the Deux - trout en croute, asparagus, dehydrated tomato, lobster bisque!!! Okay the word ""lobster"" sold it to me! And it definitely was a great choice! The staffs were great and considering how busy it was, the waiting time for the food wasn't too long."
73,Wei S.,9/11/2014,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"This is an all-time favourite of mine and a bunch of girlfriends! Best known for its weekend brunches, be prepared to treat yourself!! My favourite savoury dish would be their baked eggs. They usually have 3 flavours available for brunch (I think they mix these flavours up a bit each time they change the menu)... Herb mushrooms on toast are a treat too! This seems to be an all time favourite as it's been on the menu for awhile. I also recently discovered pork belly with fried eggs. This dish sounds decadent for brunch but is oh-so-good! But the BEST part or brunch at Hardware Societe is the fried brioche! I have never walked out of this place once without having it's fried brioche. On weekends, there'll be a special in addition to what's on the menu. These flavours change regularly too but they are nearly always amazing! I've been here for a fried brioche the same day I had some teeth extractions and it was the only thing I wanted! I should also mention that they used to serve all coffees with a little cinnamon donut, about the size of a teaspoon. They were delicious! Seems to have stopped recently but would be amazing if they brought that back. Two thumbs up for my favourite brunch spot in melbs!!"
74,Celina L.,7/31/2018,"Preston, Australia",1 star rating,"Horrible service!Giving this place 1 star not by choice but because I cannot give them a zero. I waited in line with a friend of mine today at around 11:30 am for about 20 minutes and when we were seated, we were taken to the tiniest oval communal table I've ever seen with 7 other people already seated. There was seriously no space to even move my elbows out once I was seated, it was insanely cramped. When the waitress came over, my friend and I ordered coffees and we asked if we could move to a table when one comes free. The waitress told us we had to get back in line if we want to wait for a table. I told her that's really silly since we already waited and she said she'll go talk to her manager. While we waited for her to come back, a couple that were sitting to the right of us left the table. When the manager came over, she asked us if we wanted to move over to their seats and we said we would prefer it if we could get a table as we could see a few tables becoming free. After all, we came before lunch, so it wasn't as busy as it usually is. She said it's not possible and she can't help us. So I told her that we wouldn't have stood in line if we knew we would be seated on an insanely tiny table eating our lunch with the whole of Melbourne. So we got the coffees we ordered to go and left. Eating out in Melbourne is expensive and this cafe can't even cut out 2 stools (they weren't even chairs but those really short stools) so their customers could breathe! But you know, greed.And btw, coffee was just drinkable."
75,Les T.,4/14/2018,"Moore Park, Australia",5 star rating,"Had a great brunch here. The staff were helpful and found us a table outside. There was a line (like most places in Melbourne), but the wait was worth it. I had the Croque Madam which I'm still not entirely sure what it was, but it's one of the specialities and I would highly recommend it. Coffee was also good."
76,Louisa W.,3/09/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",2 star rating,"Sadly I was very disappointed by my recent dining experience at The Hardware Societe. I've had this place bookmarked for ages & all the other positive reviews & pictures of delicious food had well & truly sold it to me.There is always a queue outside, therefore when I arrived I joined it. Only to then see people turn up from nowhere & go in ahead of those in the queue. I inquired with the server as to if there was a booking system & was instructed that I should have read the sign (said sign simply said that a server would be with you once you joined the queue, no reference to giving your name to them before joining  the end). Thankfully the wait was not too long & we were shown to our table. The table had barely been cleaned from the last diners & we were left with a half empty bottle of warm water rather than being provided with a fresh one. I ordered the baked eggs, which were over cooked when they landed on the table and having come straight out of the oven obviously continued to cook & despite stirring vigorously as I had been advised to do by the server they ultimately became burnt & stuck to the pot...all very unpleasant. The only positive was that the pesto bread was tasty.My friend simply opted for some gluten free toast & again we were left a little dismayed when she lifted the lid off the butter dish to discover that it only contained a smear of crumby butter. Just one choice of preserve was provided which had a fly enjoying it's lunch probably more than we did!!!I appreciate that this place is busy with a high turnover but poor customer service & not restocking the basics is not acceptable when you're paying a slightly above average price."
77,Chuy B.,12/02/2016,"Santa Ana, CA",5 star rating,"Ok, if you're a foodie, (and if you're in Melbourne I take you're a foodie for granted) this is the place you want to go! is placed on a walkway street in CBD, where you can smell the trendy and pure spirit of the city, the restaurant is tiny and you may need to wait in line on weekends to have your ""Brekky"" but it's totally worth it. it's sort of a French fusion amazing cuisine, I ordered the Croque Madame and bf had the Bennies, both amazing and unique, never tried anything like that before but the dish essence isn't lost either. on my opinion this place is a must for brunch in the bohemian capital down-under."
78,Karmen Y.,8/17/2014,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely fantastic breakfast/brunch place. I think this is a must-try in Melbourne! From the atmosphere to the food, it was a memorable experience. I was very happy with the Baked Eggs Deux (with chorizo) and the Coddled Eggs (which was like a charcuterie platter) and both were delicious. As a bread fantatic, their bread here is just MMMMPH.It is a very small place and gets crowded very easily so I do not recommend going in a large group (2-4 people is most ideal). I was able to only sneak in a spot going as 2, but I think if the wait is not too long, it is worth the experience."
79,Krystal F.,3/23/2017,"Rialto, CA",5 star rating,"Immediately when I got there I was greeted by one of the kindest waiters.  I wish I would've asked him his name at the time.  He greeted me with a smile and proceeded to assist me in finding a place to sit. Before I got to my table, however, he asked me if I would be comfortable in a regular chair or a stool.  I know this doesn't sound like much, but when you are on the chunky side chairs with or without handles matter to your overall comfort. I was extremely excited to see that I didn't have to approach this conversation first.  And that never happens!Besides this illuminatingly rich and warm customer service, the food was amazing.  The fried brioche with passionfruit curd and creme fraiche was a highlight to my very first morning in Melbourne.  I will always remember it as a part of my holiday."
80,Vincent J.,6/27/2018,"Brisbane, Australia",5 star rating,"One of my staples for Melbourne Brekkie.

81,Stephanie W.,5/13/2018,"Freshwater, Australia",2 star rating,"A very average cafe in regards to Melbourne standards. Luke warm coffee, over priced meals and over complicated breakfast. I recommend going to the cafe across the lane called Hash."
82,Clara A.,3/27/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",3 star rating,We have waiting 45 min to have a table. We hope it was a fantastic moment. But the are was too noisy and the place was not comfortable. The menu propose different meals. But the price is expensive and the meal's flavour aren't fantastic. But I took the raspberry pistachio green tea cake which was very tasty :)
83,Michelle B.,3/29/2016,"Perth, Australia",3 star rating,"Always a line for this cafe and with its hype we decided to join the line. After about a 25 minute wait we got shown to a table. The service was very friendly and the coffee was really good. I ordered the daily special which was a confit duck pie with poached eggs. The dish was flavourful, but unfortunately was only Luke warm and the pastry had lost its crunch and flakyness."
84,ML ..,12/11/2016,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Had a really good time here and enjoyed our brunch.  The portions are pretty large and that hot chocolate, wowzers, nice and rich. Their waiting list method was somewhat of a hot mess.  You have to wait for someone to come out and sort out who was all there first to put the names down.  Not sure why they don't have a board out there for the patrons to sign as they show up."
85,Sharon H.,3/21/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"Hardware Societe is arguably one of the most popular, famous and consistent brunch place in Melbourne since they first opened in 2010. It's certainly My Mom's favourite brunch spot, every time she visit me from Indonesia she had to have their Fried Brioche. She claimed it to be the best Fried Brioche ever and my mom does travel and eat a lot so she know's what she is talking about. Head Chef Jean Paul Dargan is known for using seasonal produce on their menu which may result in slight variations to the menu such as they used different fruits every seasoned on their french toast."
86,Jennie L.,11/07/2015,"Richmond Hill, Canada",5 star rating,"Who doesn't love a hearty breakfast? And this restaurant definitely served some of the best breakfast dishes that I've ever had! My friends and I had the Lobster Benedict and Baked Eggs. Both were out of this world! I love eggs benedicts and I love lobsters, so when I saw lobster benedict on the menu, it was a no-brainer. And boy was it a good choice! There were chunks of lobster sitting on a buttery brioche, with perfectly poached eggs on top covered in a blanket of hollandaise sauce. It was definitely that best eggs benedict I've ever had. My friend chose to order the Baked Eggs. At first I had my doubts, as it sounded a bit boring, but he insisted on getting it based on the reviews of others, and I was so glad that he did. This was a very unique dish and I'm not sure how to best describe it; each bite was just such an amazing explosion of flavours in my mouth. If you came here and could only get one thing, definitely try the Baked Eggs as you wouldn't be able to get this anywhere else!It is a very cozy restaurant, with not too many tables. The service was very quick and friendly, but we never felt rushed even though we could see the line starting to form outside. We came around 10am on a weekday, and were seated within 10 mins."
87,Scott J.,3/04/2014,"Sydney, Australia",3 star rating,"Perfect start to the day, Food is amazing and staff were great, the menu was world class and def a place you have to experience in Melb. The coffees were small and they only carry one size, this was a little disappointing as they should have large coffee instead of making you purchase two. Unable to add your choices as they don't allow sides, I like crispy bacon with my eggs. All that said I still enjoyed what I ordered."
88,Carl N.,2/03/2016,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"This is one of the best brunches I've have ever had!My girlfriend and I were visiting from San Francisco and heard about Hardware Societe. This place lives us to the hype. I got the omelette with jambon and my gf got the salmon creatively cooked 3 different ways. The food was exceptional and the ambience/service was very friendly and welcome, despite the growing long lines. They are right, get there early however you will not be disappointed!"
89,Terry V.,8/11/2013,"Nashville, TN",4 star rating,"Couldn't have started the day better! The line wasn't too bad and we were seated on the bar where we could see all the creations being made in real time with great precision and expertise.I ordered the omelette that had zucchini, cherry tomatoes, crab, and fennel remoulade. Pretty tasty and incredibly filling! I loved how it came with two pieces of baguettes that were super tasty with a touch of olive oil on them. My friend ordered the bircher muesli with raspberries and seeds with toasted hazelnuts with a poached pear. It also came with a large croissant which looked amazing and buttery.The space was adorable and we had a great time eating and catching up. Service was good. Refilled our drinks when we needed them too and took our plates when we were finished without rushing us. They were attentive and seemed to be running around the entire time. The place surprised me that it was cash only so be aware before you go! Definitely worth visiting if you're in Melbourne for a few days."
90,Sophia N.,9/28/2015,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,Cute little french place on hardware lane in the city. A nice and cosy place to have some breakfast and coffee with some of your gal pals or your partner. Have tried most of the dishes on the menu and there is nothing to fault. My favourite dish here is the baked eggs. So delicious. Wouldn't get it anywhere else
91,Miriam W.,6/17/2013,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Even on weekdays this sweet little cafe at the end of Hardware Lane is packed with patrons eager to sink their appetites into creative plates like bircher muesli, fried brioche and sardines on toast.Luckily, my dining company had the foresight to think ahead and was already seated at a table when I arrived. I ordered chai which came out creamy and spicy (just how I like it) and baked eggs with chorizo which fueled me for the day (I love savoury breakfasts)!This is a Melbourne brunch not to be missed, just make sure to bring cash to pay for it (they don't take cards)."
92,Jeany L.,10/30/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,One of my go-to brunch destination. Always packed on the weekend but waiting for a table is not that long. Always order their hot chocolate! Thick and satisfying!
93,Jesse S.,10/02/2015,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"Good brunches, coffee and cakes but I hate waiting in line so we basically never go.As others have said the baked eggs are not to be missed. I watched how the guy did it and then ripped it off at home -- surprisingly easy and no waiting in line :)Many of the gluten free cakes are also pretty good."
94,Duncan S.,2/08/2018,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"I'm not a huge breakfast person beyond good coffee but felt compelled to leave a review because it was so good. I ordered the barrata, which was fantastic and vegetarian to boot. It was fun watching the kitchen staff make everything from the counter. It was busy but not packed on a Friday morning."
95,Leslie L.,10/03/2015,"La Salle, France",5 star rating,"The chef was accommodating! The food was artful and delicious. The breakfast options were rich, and inspired. Everything was cooked to order impeccably. The poached eggs with mushrooms was so tasty  and memorable. We were visiting Melbourne for the first time from Los Angeles, CA. We would recommend this place for a hearty and comforting breakfast."
96,Sophie W.,2/03/2018,"Windsor, Australia",5 star rating,We all know this is the Mac daddy in Melb for breakfast. Always huge waiting line and the food explains why. Friendly and efficient staff- the meals are delicious and heavy - perfect place to eat after a big night out
97,Two S.,11/10/2016,"Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"Lived up to the hype from my point of view and likewise for my friend.  The breakfast was superb, the coffee lovely and the service efficient and affable.  Not cheap but it's an excellent experience. Recommended."
98,Karla S.,12/10/2017,"PORTER RANCH, CA",5 star rating,Truly excellent Service and food. It was a culinary delight. We had the scrambled eggs with chorizo and asparagus and the baked eggs in a pot. Highly recommended. What was most delightful was the service model where the entire team worked together to assure that everyone was taken care of. From seating to check out : perfection
99,L G.,5/03/2016,"Placentia, CA",5 star rating,The baked eggs and chorizo is sublime! It is soooo good! You will not regret ordering  it. Truly one of the best dishes I've ever tasted. Combined with a friendly server and host and our experience at Hardware Societe was top notch. Great way to cap off our vacation. Will surely return when we come back to Melbourne.
100,Sallyanne E.,3/24/2013,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"I absolutely adore coming here for brunches and lunches!! Such a cute little spot hidden on a laneway with incredibly inviting decor, nice outdoor seating, lovely staff and oh yeah- fabulous food!!I've literally not had anything bad from the menu, and the potions are generous (but not ridiculous- this is French inspired cuisine after all!)I kind of wish there were no reviews for HS so I could keep it a secret, but damn I just want everyone to have such a delightful experience! Enjoy! Bon appétit!"
101,Mallaury G.,9/09/2015,"Paris, France",5 star rating,"We had a perfect breakfast at the Hardware Societe! We went on a Friday morning and didn't even wait too long to be seated inside (yes, spring and it's still freezing in Melbourne!). The menu is so amazing that everything looks delicious and we literally wanted to try half of the menu out.I finally opted for the chorizo baked eggs, after speaking a bit with the friendly French waiter about what was the best decision to make (that was a critical choice we had to make). Terrific dish, really! The French brioche looked so amazing as well and we'd have loved to give it a try if we weren't already full after eating our dish.Also ordered a long black coffee -first coffee in Melbourne!- and I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with the taste, but anyway.I loved the atmosphere and the decoration inside. People working here are lovely as well. Well deserved five star rating!"
102,Eric B.,11/25/2017,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"The brunch here was sooooooooo good. Many creative takes on classic dishes with top notch ingredients. Cool vibe and service on a quaint little alley. Hardware Societe a is a clinic in what brunch should be! If you find yourself in Melbourne and are into this sort of thing, don't hesitate, you won't be disappointed!"
103,Chris B.,2/03/2013,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"My friends couldn't believe their ears when I told them that they'd have to wait half an hour for a table for breakfast. ""How good can this place be?"" ""Why can't we just have toast?"".Hardware Societe, as ever, didn't disappoint. We ended up waiting closer to an hour after a squad of young families enjoyed coffee after coffee on what was destined to be our table. We finally took a seat outside, embracing the breeze of Hardware lane and allowing the jealous looks of those behind us in the queue to wash over us like an ocean wave.The food, as ever, was amazing. It can tend to be pricey, but you definitely get your money's worth and the staff are friendly and helpful to boot. Coffees were not amazing, but the little doughnut ball on the side made it worthwhile (Doughnuts? breakfast? What!?). If you're there in a small group (one, two or possibly three), try and get one of the seats overlooking the kitchen area. Watching the food be prepared is certainly a sight to be beheld.Three endnotes: - A close friend of mine wished for me to note that they do, in fact, wash their drinking glasses in the same water as they wash egg-dirtied dishes. This apparently introduces an eggy taste to the glass. I didn't notice it in this instance but perhaps his sense of smell is keener than mine. - No EFTPOS or credit card facilities! Remember to bring cash. - Upon checking in, I received a follow-up tweet from the owners within several minutes. Cool!"
104,Ellie C.,5/18/2015,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"Okay so we had to wait an hour on Easter weekend for a table here. and then we were out of there 30 mins after being seated! So efficiency is key here, even if there's a bit of a line to begin with. While this place isn't really suitable to become your new inner city local, it's definitely worthy of being on your 'cafes to visit in Melbourne' list, and everyone should drop by once or twice. Awesome food and coffee, pretty ace service and it doesn't break the bank. I had some kind of pork belly thing with eggs and it was phenomenal."
105,Janet C.,4/20/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"This was our first breakfast in Melbourne. It was busy but the line moved quickly and the staff was very accommodating. Ex. Our bistro table was a bit exposed to the elements but when another sheltered table opened we were moved. Our waiter was friendly helpful and attentive. I had the croissant,vanilla yogurt, pears; my husband the scrambled eggs with marinated bacon. Both orders were scrumptious. The total : with 2 oj and a shared pot of tea for 2 ; $53.00Money well spent."
106,Cecilia Z.,5/03/2016,"Sydney, Australia",4 star rating,"First meal after landing in Mel, very tasty and special, different layers with different senses for ur tongue."
107,Roxy L.,10/24/2015,"IL, IL",5 star rating,This place is fantastic. Came right before hoarders of people were queuing outside. Sat at a long table with a bunch of strangers. Service is top notch and the food will change your life! I had the baked eggs deux and it was out of this world. I'm not a coffee drinker but the iced coffee served with ice cream and chocolate milk could make me one. You don't want to miss out on this place!
108,Henrique K.,2/22/2013,Australia,5 star rating,"I went to Hardware Society for breakfast, I was struggling to choose something from the menu I decided to have the special of the day, chorizo sweet corn croquet, two organic poached eggs, baguette and nuts capsicum sauce. I didn't know what to expect and Wow, it was so good! no wonder the place got completely packed a few minutes after opening.Food was delicious, service also great. Coffee was good but the way the waiter explained about it I thought i was going to have the best coffee in the world, and it wasn't. I guess it all depends on your personal taste."
109,Artemis H.,4/15/2015,"Sydney, Australia",4 star rating,"I do have to commend this cafe for their good quality food, dainty French playground chic interior vibe and interesting menu. However I didn't particularly find the food appetizing, I gave four stars mainly for the quality and effort. This is a small restaurant, even on non-traditional busy days you may find yourself waiting in line for seating. I don't believe they take reservations. Whilst intriguing, I found the menu limited, brave and inventive. Really had to peruse the menu a bit before reaching a safe option. Our favourite was definitely the fried brioche. We were after a brunch style offering of food so this place made the cut. All in all we had a pleasant experience here but not in a rush to go back but still recommend for you to try. The only thing I found distasteful were the patrons."
110,Rebecca T.,7/03/2015,"Richmond, Australia",4 star rating,I was a little hesitant to try this one.... But I was proven wrong! The food was lovely the service was amazing and a very cute atmosphere. I had ordered a soy flat white and then as my brunch came out the service assistant came over and said - oh my god I'm so sorry I should have told you that there maybe be cream in the potato bake. I can change it for you she went onto to say... I politely said I was okay but was completely wowed by the service and the fact shed even remembered. Get there early however even on a rainy cold day there was still a 45 minute wait!!!
111,Kimmy C.,11/27/2014,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"This cute french influenced cafe is quite the charm in Melbourne. In the not so popular alleyway hides a busy cafe that has lines even on a weekday. That would surely tell you how good this place is. If you want to grab coffee ahead of time while you are waiting for breakfast, they have a coffee bar where you can order and enjoy your cup of joe. I had the decadent french toast that seemed to be one of the most popular items on the menu. My friends enjoyed their baked eggs. What was nice is that their options were either vegetarian or not. I say that this place creatively presents their breakfast a plate to serve. Table sharing is mostly required and don't be shy because the french cafe is as cozy as it can get. They try to squeeze as many patrons indoor and outside the store front. Coffee here was amazing and I got to savor my flat white to the very last drop. Come check this place out!"
112,Tresna L.,2/28/2013,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"It's easy to see why this is such a favourite spot for Melburnians. With proper teacups and saucers and pots of tea that come in two sizes (for 1 or 2), compete with tea cosy, this is a great spot for afternoon tea. But why would you come just for a drink when you could come for brunch and take on the likes of blueberry and coconut loaf or the positively ginourmous bircher muesli which is one of the best I've ever had? It's huge, studded with raspberries and seeds and scattered with loads of toasted hazelnuts and a big serving of poached fruit. I don't know anyone that could finish it, so be prepared to share or (if you're like me) confront your food wastage guilt. You need to choose your moments to visit or be prepared to wait for a table. It's hugely popular which means things are a little frantic inside and you won't be able to sit here for hours luxuriating over a newspaper."
113,Kathy L.,8/30/2014,"Auckland, New Zealand",4 star rating,"Came here for an early breakfast before an exam with a friend. Found this one after looking for popular cafes in the Melbourne CBD. We came shortly after their 7.30am opening and it was quickly filling up- both inside and outside.Got a lovely trim flat white with the cutest little mini cinnamon donut on the side- which was also delicious. Neat heart pattern- a small one above a large one on top. For breakfast, got their vegetarian un baked eggs while friend got their very cool sweet platter with 3 dessert like minis on a wooden board. The eggs came in a wee little metal pot with a lid (to be stirred) on a wooden board with a side of small pieces of crusty bread- Tasty.Loved the French feel of the place with it's beautiful furniture, retro cool hanging lights and feature wall with butterfly wallpaper. Had a great wall of hanging tea cups at the main counter and range of tables and seating. Cool sweet treats on sale where you pay. Think their head chef, has a great philosophy in using seasonal produce with slightly varying menu. Very cute place with good food and coffee."
114,Dayse G.,5/25/2016,"São Paulo, Brazil",1 star rating,"I went there three times, at first and second time, it was good. The service was   Fast and waiters friendly. Dishes were tasty, besides expensive. But at third my partner and I asked fried brioche and bircher and both were terrible!!! We just couldn't have them. Totally different from the pictures because they change The menu every week. Without raspberries, cherries, chocolate, or any good thing. We got fully disapoitment!!!!"
115,Jo Y.,5/24/2016,"Leederville, Australia",4 star rating,"Beautiful breakfast, absolutely everything on the menu looks and sounds delicious. There is a line, so you do need to get there for 8.30am to get a seat. I ordered a decadent hot chocolate, imagine a glob of chocolate in a mug served with a pot of hot milky goodness to pour over! Breakfast consisted of baked chorizo eggs and Spanish peppers. It was so delicious! I can't wait to come back!"
116,Andrew P.,6/22/2015,"Surry Hills, Sydney, Australia",5 star rating,"The Atmosphere was very warm and definitely lively, not what i expected when i walked by for a quick lunch. It definitely was a gastronomic approach to lunch.I came in an ordered what was on special It was a grilled Tuna Steak with a deconstructed Nicoise Salad. The Fish was cooked perfectly, firm and the acidity of capers helped cut through the richness of the fish. The variety of textures, from the fish to the roasted potatoes and zucchini, the crunch of the microherbs and the creaminess of an amazing puree made every mouthful delicious. A definite must try, apparently breakfast here is the place to go i just missed it. It seems a local staple here for people in Melbourne."
117,Amy C.,4/10/2013,"Sydney, Australia",4 star rating,"Overrated experience. For some unknown reason, the infamous baked eggs at Hardware Societe has attracted flocks of brunch-lovers since its opening as an affirmation to Melbourne's uber-cool hipster food scene. But if you're hoping to test out the waters of this city's brunch culture, you can prepare yourself for at least hour-long waits into the midday, rude waitresses snapping at the lines that (understandably) flood the narrow laneway, and the inevitable disappointment of being served food far below the hype. After asking for recommendations and having half the menu halfheartedly recited to us by a distracted waiter, our group of four settled on trying the popular baked eggs. Here's a lesson to all: Don't order this just to try it out because the idea of baked eggs sound unique and interesting, because you won't enjoy it. I honestly have no idea what all the fuss is about - this dish is one of a select few that have the rare combination of being both heavy yet tasteless. The portion was impractically large and left no one satisfied. Honestly, it left me wishing that some things, like brunch, were better left untouched by the city's hipster food creators."
118,Donald Y.,5/20/2017,"Melbourne, Australia",2 star rating,"- Small varied menu, but goddamn everything on it sounded delicious- Clean, slick, brightly lit modern decor & ambience, tonnes of attentive and efficient wait staff- Lamb was good, duck was good, I'm sure everything on the menu is good! Would love to try"
119,T K.,9/04/2012,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"My wife and I came here on a Saturday for brunch and were able to get a seat within 20 minutes despite a long appearing line. We got the hot chocolate which was delicious -- the chocolate base was not a powder but a chocolatey butter. So. Good. We got the mushroom toast served on a walnut bread with a bean purée, hazelnuts and poached egg. This was hands down the best mushroom toast we've ever had -- every component was cooked to perfection and it was clear that the chef paid attention to aesthetics, flavor, and texture. We finished with the fried brioche served with s chocolate chantilly and passion fruit custard topped with a meringue. The dish was a culinary adventure and a great one at that. We have had many a French toast and brioche and this topped the ones we've had at nopa in SF and the kitchen in providence."
120,Danni G.,4/20/2014,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"The naughtiest healthy breakfast I've had but it was oh so nice.When Bircher muesli tastes like a luscious, luxurious dessert I know this is not the type of Bircher muesli Mish prescribes the 12wbt disciples.  With each creamy, deliciously balanced  sweet bite I wonder what sort of workout I am going to need to do to burn off all of this ""healthy"" goodness.  Especially when I top it off with the deservedly acclaimed hot chocolate, what a delight this is.Whilst I contemplate the pleasures of my choices and the pain that will need to follow, I am in awe of the fried brioche with lavender panna cotta that my friend is relishing but alas he is defeated and can not finish the final few bites of brioche.Service here is efficient with our meals arriving in a matter of moments.  The gorgeous fit out and frenchy music made me feel like I was in Paris...thankfully without the attitude.  Hardware Societe is the perfect example of naughty but nice, very, very, nice."
121,Wendy F.,2/20/2015,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"Breakfast here was a treat! 7.30am before work I adventurously selected the pork belly which arrived on a bed of smashed leeky potatoes topped with a horseradish cream and next to 2 eggs on toast. I did say I was adventurous! Service was warm, friendly and made us smile. Service was quick considering this cafe steadily moved towards bustling as it got later. It was a warm morning so we sat outside. It was a good choice. Although I found the chairs a bit uncomfy. The arms kept getting in my way. The food - the pork was mouth watering. It fell apart on the fork just how it should. The crackling could have been a bit crunchier, a bit less rubbery. I love potatoes, these were Devine! Seriously yummy. The potato leek combination is always a winner. The eggs and toast were delicious too. Overall a great dish. I was warned it was a huge dish by the waiters. They were right but I was up to it. I intend to go back and work my way through the menu. Prices were quite reasonably. The only negative came when it was time to pay. My friend and I, plus a number of other diners queued at the registered where meals and coffee where being collected by wait staff. They were also weaving through us with cleared plates back to the kitchen all the while we danced back and forth trying to avoid them. It was a bit of a wait so somewhat annoying. Easily fixed by a bit of re arrangement of the cash register location. All up my vote is Yes Please!"
122,Kiera S.,5/31/2014,"London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"As everyone else says, the line is long. As everyone else says, the line is very much worth it. Delicious baked eggs (I'm not usually much of an egg eater, but these were amazing!!). You won't be hungry afterwards. The coffee was ok, but not amazing. Staff was efficient but not overly friendly. But the FOOD.... amazing. Can't go wrong."
123,CJ B.,2/02/2013,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"What fun and quite yum!  This is a very high energy place which is deservedly popular. Luckily, we were able to find seats at the counter where we could watch the kitchen staff work its magic.On our first visit to Melbourne we went here for breakfast but unfortunately, as it was our last day in town, we could not return to sample more of the enticing menu items. The entire menu tempted us, especially as we watched the individual dishes being prepared.  We finally settled on charcuterie with coddled eggs (a very generous plate which allowed for some sharing) and cold rice pudding with cherries, both of which were delicious.The restaurant is on one of Melbourne's famous laneways. This laneway is not as hopping as some of the others, but you should DEFINITELY make the extra effort to seek out this great find."
124,Shane R.,5/11/2014,"Melbourne, Australia",1 star rating,"I keep hearing how wonderful this place is but waiting in line is not my thing. One day I noticed there was no line. I went in, was seated and waited... And waited. I got the attention of wait staff who indicated they would serve another table then me... Then I waited some more. Eventually my patience wore out and I simply left.Which is how I found the delightful cafe across the lane."
125,Alvarez W.,3/26/2015,"Aspen, CO",5 star rating,Consistent. Delicious. Very much what you might find in France. I've had dreams about the rice pudding. Service is great. I love this place!
126,Michael S.,6/21/2015,"Tulsa, OK",5 star rating,"Great, fast service and delicious specials. I ordered the sweet brunch special without even looking at the menu, and it was worth it. Loved this place! It's busy though, so come In a small group, or come early."
127,Sam Q.,8/02/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,Was my first meal when I arrived to MLB. Great and unique food. The service was prefect. Don't miss Dux baked eggs I consider it a signature dish.
128,James M.,5/27/2017,"College Park, MD",2 star rating,Came here because of the super high reviews. Wasn't really my thing. It was small and felt cramped. I ordered the pork belly breakfast and she got the porridge. Both were alright but I've had better. The toast in particular wasn't to my liking. It wasn't burned but it was extremely stiff and tasted like it had anise in it.
129,amy m.,5/05/2017,Australia,4 star rating,I really loved this place. Make your coffee order as long as you like. Not a problem. Food is creative and delicious. Only downside is the wait outside for a table at peak times.
130,Edward W.,5/23/2014,"Locust Grove, GA",5 star rating,"As a part of my first trip to Oz, this was recommended by a couple of locals I had met. The place was very busy, about a 20min wait. When party was finally seated and served...I completely understood what all the fuss was about. Breakfast or Brunch! When in Melnourne this should be one everyone's meal stops!!!"

133,Jane S.,11/08/2015,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,Worth the long wait - cute spot for brunch with date or catch up with friends over the weekend. Pork belly was rich but perfectly cooked. Be prepared to make some new friends if you are a small group and you get placed on the large communal table. Fun and helpful as you get to see up close and ask what people ordered before you order from their impressive menu. Definitely coming back to try their other items!
134,Laura N.,10/28/2013,"Bellevue, WA",4 star rating,"Bring cash, get there early and grab a spare seat if you can - this little cafe deserves all of the buzzing attention it gets. Though I nibbled a few bites of the Yelp rave-inducing baked eggs and chorizo, and drooled over some sort of fried egg, toast and prosciutto volcano monster brekkie that made me full just looking at it, I ended up with the stalwart and fan-favourite bircher muesli with fresh fruit and nuts. I honestly believe this is the type of place where you really can't go wrong, and you could easily challenge yourself and a dining companion to sample the entire menu. The tea pots (and accompanying cozies) were beyond precious, but I couldn't help but assume they were jealous of the delicious spoon doughnuts that the coffees come with. Or maybe that was just me..."
135,Ghen L.,12/04/2015,"Newton, Singapore, Singapore",4 star rating,I'm addicted to the Baked eggs with Chorizos. One of the busiest breakfast/brunch places in Melbourne. Be prepared to queue up for 30-40 minutes If you're a late starter.
136,Alex C.,4/22/2018,"New York, NY",5 star rating,i stayed right by this cafe for 3 days in melbourne and enjoyed multiple coffees. the coffee is very good. service is excellent. always got a yummy lil donut hole with my coffees. watching the lineups that accumulated throughout the day here was intriguing and it's obvious why - the food looked fanatastic. i didn't eat here but i know it would be good.
137,David T.,2/16/2015,"Garden Grove, CA",5 star rating,"Get Lost! Visiting Melbourne early in the morning, I realize I'm all alone because the rest of my entourage continues their recovery mode in unconsciousness at the hostel, while I search for mercy via food and drink. I'm thinking about eggs this morning and I'm lost in a city that doesn't support my kind of breakfast as the United States supports my kind of breakfast. I gallantly strive into a curious alleyway. Apparently, here in Melbourne, businesses take up every square inch of space and there's not much room for seedy nooks. So alleyways are full of sunshine, smiles and positive surprises, like The Hardware Societe. This breakfast/brunch, upscale hole-in-the-wall offers me a healthy selection of sinful breakfasts, mostly honoring the egg. Strike gold! Examples include: baked eggs in a mini vegetable cauldron, fried egg a la pork belly, egg and Spanish-style chorizo. Accompanied by elegant crostini-cut toast, these sufficiently-proportioned dawn dishes remind me that it's time for the letter of the day: Mmmmmm. The only caveats include sardine space inside, lengthy line outside, no substitutions available: I wanted them to create something for me. They were really strict on set menus. Good reason for it too. What was that letter of the day again?"
138,Matthew D.,4/20/2016,"Hawthorn East, Australia",5 star rating,"Absolutely awesome Baked Eggs, can't recommend the Duos, chorizo flavour enough. Complemented with great tea and awesome atmosphere, this is my favourite breakfast spot in Melbourne."
139,Andrew R.,10/19/2014,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"Great cafe. Breakfast menu a little limited but you can't go wrong with baked eggs with chorizo.  Their coffee is pretty good,  amazing hot chocolate. If more menu variety is desired come after 11 or 12 for lunch and brunch menu. Porkbelly is really good, very tender and juicy, also comes with two fried on top of a toast with spicy onions, might be a little to much. The ambience is good and service is fairly good for such a busy cafe. Nice seating outside on the hardware lane. Only downside is the waiting time, you either have to come for early breakfast or late brunch/lunch. Otherwise it's at least a 15-20 in the warmer months."
140,Ali H.,7/05/2016,"Wellington, New Zealand",4 star rating,"This is a delightful cafe. It offers a bright, welcoming space with appealing decor, great service and good coffee. Most tables are for sharing but there's plenty of room. I love the casual 'homey' feel and the whole atmosphere. I'll be back."
141,Alicia N.,9/16/2013,"Adelaide, Australia",5 star rating,"I had heard that this was 'the best breakfast in Melbourne' and I was certainly not disappointed! Luckily I planned to visit on a Friday morning when it was 'quieter' because it was still extremely busy - for two of us it was a struggle to get a table while a few people were turned, away - and certainly not for lack of space, there are plenty of tables here, it's just that they were all full! Delighted to get a table, thanks to the lovely and oh so friendly staff, my Mum and I sat down and began drooling over the amazing menu!I ordered the baked eggs with chorizo while while she ordered a dish that came with some little poached eggs in shot glasses and bits of cheese, salmon, little pickles and tasty meats to nibble on. Both were served with yummy bread and in fantastic time, considering that the cafe was so incredibly full!The food was wonderful but for me, the absolute stand - out highlight was the amazing hot chocolate. So rich and tasty and so so so much of it - for only $5 which is so cheap compared to other places that have served me up very very average hot chocolates for much more.Put this on your list of must try places - but from all reports, try to avoid a weekend if you don't like lines!"
142,A T.,12/08/2015,"Singapore, Singapore",4 star rating,"Fabulous coffee. Great eggs - baked eggs, Lobster Benedict. Innovative and yet done perfectly. You cannot go wrong with any item on its all-day brunch menu. Great ambience and wonderful friendly staff to assure you of a great dining experience. Be warned tho' ..... the queue can get pretty long, so either time your visit or be prepared to spend some time catching up whilst staying on the queue."
143,Demi C.,4/27/2015,"Pain Court, Canada",4 star rating,Service and atmosphere was top knotch at Hardware Société however I found the food to be so/so.  I got the scrambled eggs with salmon.  The salmon was light and tasty however the bread it came with was a little too thick and dense for my taste.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and such a big portion.  Definetely couldn't finish it all by myself.  Also love the little donut given with each hot beverage!
144,George L.,12/29/2015,"Carrollton, TX",4 star rating,"Great breakfast place hidden off what seems like an alleyway.  The baked egg No. Deux was great and the Lobster Benedict was good, but seemed to be missing some flavor.  The Fried Brioche was phenomenal, but a little rich.  It is a little pricey, but well worth it. Everything here fit, the decor, the food and the ambiance."
145,Taylie T.,10/17/2015,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",4 star rating,I had pork belly & fried eggs with a cup of soy latte. I love the pork belly. The portion is good. It's a good place to have brunch. It does get real busy during weekend. My advise is to go on weekday before lunch hour. I had to wait awhile before I got my place.
146,Courtney B.,7/05/2014,"Leichhardt, Sydney, Australia",4 star rating,"Amazing hidden away restaurant that is seriously buzzing. Saw the huge crowd of people before we spotted the cafe. Had to wait about 30min for a table and got put on the communal table which we really didn't mind, it's wide enough for the people across from you to not hear if you don't want them to. Got the baked chorizo eggs which were good. Saw the brioche and which I got that. Also tried the lavender and blueberry cold pressed juice which was ok. Wouldn't get it again. Coffee was lovely but I got forgotten and had to remind the waitress of it, but bo dramas. Would go again for sure"
147,Angelica P.,12/07/2016,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,Best brunch place in Melbourne according to several websites and the food is really great.  Service is better than most places in Melbourne but not the best.  Expect to queue for quite sometime unless you have a booking or arrive upon opening.  Food is creative and delicious.  Expect a sizeable portion for its cost and one that is filling.
148,Jo B.,8/03/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"There are only two things that stop this being a 5-star venue for me: firstly, they removed my favourite pork belly dish from their menu. I'm devastated! Secondly, it's impossible to get a seat here without a wait, unless it's 9am on a Monday, and even then, you might have to queue. But there's a reason it's incredibly popular, because the food at atmosphere here is wonderful. Unfortunately, it's is now so well known that my inner-hipster has almost lost interest. However, I'm sure HS will continue doing amazing food and a roaring trade. And I'll probably still walk past now and again, in the vain hope of it being quiet, and to linger over the sweet treats on display, and think about the good old days when I first discovered this lovely little pocket of Hardware St."
149,Jen Y.,3/28/2017,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",5 star rating,"Excellent food and great service. We ordered the Lobster Benedict and pulled duck breakfast sandwich with eggs. Both dishes were simply delicious and unique. Great drinks also. Come early if you don't want to wait, otherwise there will be a queue to this awesome place!"
150,Karen B.,12/05/2015,"Shellharbour, Australia",5 star rating,I'm not in Melbourne. I've not eaten here since 2013. Yet two years on and my husband and I still compare every Croque Madame we eat to the one we had here at The Hardware Societè.And you're getting 5 stars because you're still the best :-)
151,Kelsey H.,11/10/2013,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"THE. BEST. HOT. CHOCOLATE. EVER! I'm a soy-drinker and this soy hot chocolate was just phenomenal.I've had the continental breakfast here, which was delicious and such fantastic value for money! I've also had the vegetarian baked eggs which were mouth-wateringly good (though I was far too impatient and ended up burning my mouth on them. *Sigh*, will I ever learn?!).The coffee was alright - you can get better in Melbourne - but the hot chocolate's where it's at!"
152,Hailey P.,7/18/2013,"Preston, Australia",5 star rating,"Was skeptical of the queue outside at lunchtime, but it was definitely worth the wait. The pork belly here has an amazing texture and unique flavour, with generous portion sizes, so I would suggest ordering plates to share. Fast service surprisingly and not too noisy for a busy place. The iced chai was also decent with ample sizing despite not having a large size available."
153,Betty C.,3/20/2014,Australia,5 star rating,"Believe the hype... Best breakfast in Melbourne! I had the baked eggs with chorizo and an amazing coffee. Friends had the mushrooms, and another the omelette. All plates were cleaned with their delicious fresh bread. Highly recommend."
154,Brian D.,2/06/2018,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,"Delicious eggs baked in a little iron pot with chorizo, potatoes, and pine nuts with great croissant and blueberry jam. Oh and a great cappuccino, delicious.  Crowded small place with a line forming 30 min after opening.   Quite unusual menu. Left very satisfied."
155,Kat R.,9/02/2013,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"A little taste of France in Melbourne = whilst most places in hardware Lane are touristy and overpriced, this place has it all - charm, fun, a great menu and macaroons to die for.You usually have to wait a while for a table on Sats (its not open Sundays) but you;'d strugle to find a better place in the CBD for a great breaky (the baked eggs are winning) or afternoon tea."
156,Alternative B.,11/20/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"This place is always pumping no matter what time of the week you visit! And rightly so, fantastic and friendly service, lovely atmosphere and delicious Padre coffee. These guys just keep smashing it and have gone from strength to strength. Its also worth checking out their little sister Bower to Williamsburg across the lane which is relatively new. Also front of House man Aaron is a total babezilla which always helps ;) Keep it up Hardware Societe!"
157,Nasreen P.,1/22/2012,"Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia",5 star rating,"Awesome food, vibe and service. I had the omelette with bacon and brie which was amazing. Attention to detail with fitout and food presentation. Great coffee as well. Will definitely be back! If I had to pick on anything it would be the cash only payment!"
158,Feren Y.,2/13/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,The location is good and very convenient. I have heard about this place and how it is a  must try so I took my friend from overseas here for lunch.We had to wait but when we were seated the service was prompt and friendly.  It is not the cheapest cafe but the service size is decent.I got the baked eggs with chorizo and my friend got the duck confeit. We both got teas and they even came with tea cosy's!I would go back but next time would make sure I went nice and early or after the crowd has left.
159,Miriam S.,8/15/2013,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"Still as brilliant as ever, even though they don't have the original chef. He moved on to The South Melbourne Trader. This time I had the baked eggs with sausage, capsicum, cheese, olives and spinach. It was great. But as I sit on one of the stools, watching the chef preparing the meals, I couldn't help but wish I had ordered the new fried almond croissant. I tell you it looks amazing. Or the banana bread. I don't usually go for the banana bread thing but damn his was tempting, plus thanks to the high price of bananas, I crave them all the time. I can't tell you how incredibly friendly and efficient these guys are. I would come here based on that alone, even if the food wasn't as amazing as it is. Well done, guys."
160,Alice D.,8/16/2016,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"Too crowded to have a relaxing brunch on weekends. We had to share ONE table with the other 4 groups of people. Also, the server ( a man with darker skin n glasses) who registered our name on the waiting list was very rude and impatient. We waited for 30 mins and when we wanted for further asking, that server just kept asking us to read the sign and wouldn't listen to what our question was. So rude! There should be a system for those who wait in line instead of just yelling out loud (without number tags or something else). However, there is an enthusiastic male young waiter who introduced meals with patience and smiles on face. He wore a pencil on his ear and he always talks with a passionate and exaggerating tone. If u are lucky enough, u can meet him in person :p"
161,Sarah D.,2/06/2018,"South Yarra, Australia",3 star rating,The food was good and so was the service but still don't understand the ques. The seating was low and cramped like being perched in a cubby house and despite enjoying the experience have not troubled to go back. The croissants were very pleasant and the breakfast formula tasty. It was too expensive for more than a rare planned treat.
162,Albert A.,3/04/2014,"Waitara, Australia",5 star rating,"I hmmmmm... ok... loved this place!So one drizzly morning (or ""so one normal morning"" in Melbourne), I decided to make a large detour in my walk between my hotel and office (I travel for work), largely because of a recommendation from my colleague Jane Corder (holler if you're on Yelp). From what I can tell, she's quite with it when it comes to class and food.Despite spending a significant amount of time in Melbourne for someone who isn't from there, owing to a combination of family, work and the Australian Open, I struggled to find this place. Don't worry Melbournites, it just me, not you. I get lost trying to walk along the river to Rod Laver arena and have been lost on American highways with a map in hand. The photo I found of the cafe didn't help either - it was one of a neo-sleepy, suburban minimalist setting, so I wasn't looking out for a bustling cafe in a lane. Boy was I glad to have persisted!I sat down and ordered a hot chocolate. I like places which serve chocolate which didn't taste like sweet brown water. Or sweet brown milk for that matter. Let's put it this way, after drinking this chocolate I had wanted to take some (powder/flakes/melt bits) home to Sydney with me, but alas I wasn't able to find any on the shelves. Granted, I didn't ask about it. But it was that good. From memory, it wasn't a supremely high cocoa content (somewhere between 45-60%, and normally I'm a 75% person and even top shop-purchased chocolate with cocoa powder), but sometimes with chocolate, it's the way it's prepared, it's where the chocolate's from, it's whether they put in a pinch of salt. I already have quite a bit of chocolate at home from all those other wow moments, I didn't really persist this time. Might as well stock it in the memory and leave something to look forward to next time.My breakfast consisted of a skillet of baked eggs and chorizo, romesco, roasted roma tomatoes. The eggs were done just right (and in front of me), the chorizo was slightly spicy (which I loved) and the fat in the sausage was activated and made aromatic by the hot pan... mmmmmmmm it's good enough to fly back to Melbourne for! Despite being this good, I took my time, stretching out the enjoyment. I wasn't too fussed about going to my class late.Definitely worth 5 stars!"
163,Tomas Z.,8/16/2013,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"In my opinion this is the best brunch in the CBD. Do not be surprised if you have to wait over 40 minutes for a table on the weekend and believe me it's well worth that wait.If you just have 2 people try to sit at the kitchen bar top and watch how fast the chefs prepare everything in their hectic kitchen. The baked eggs are a highlight and have never disappointed, the other options for breakfast are really good too."
164,Chris R.,12/18/2015,"San Francisco, CA",2 star rating,"Pork belly and eggs where over cooked, dry, and bland. Very disappointed. My friend got a small amount of yogurt with a bit of granola and fruit. We've had better at the hotel's free breakfast."
165,Chely May R.,4/21/2013,Australia,4 star rating,"""No wonder half the amazon is chopped down"". That's what he said as he sipped on what we think THE BEST hot chocolate in Melb-Town.What is in this? I asked the cute waitress longingly, please, tell me, what it this amazing concoction, how do I make one of these at home??""Cream"" she said, a dollop of it, don't forget the chocolate ganache, Did you hear that? Chocolate Ganache! in my hot choc mug. with cream. and that's not counting the hot choc yet!We had scrambled egg with chorizo and baked egg with fetta, I am not sold yet but I will definitely be back if only for those hot choc and mini donuts.This is a completely biased review influenced by hot choc poison ;)"
166,Pete D.,6/22/2013,"Brisbane, Australia",5 star rating,"Go forth and spoil yourself with the best Breakfast Melbourne has to offer. The menu changes seasonally, and is full of surprises. Breakfast paella anyone? You MUST come early. Wait times are consistently 30-40mins, but as every one knows, it's well worth the wait. The coffee is good, and comes served with a mini donut hole, which is nice. The range of food is moderate, but every option is well thought out, and well sized. Not so much to make you overly full, but enough to sate your hunger.The seating is this biggest challenge here, and is very much 'make do with what you've got' Every time I come to Melbourne, I ensure I make time for Breakfast here. Between blood orange porridge, ham baked eggs, brioche and croissants, there isn't much lacking on the menu."
167,Giuseppe P.,8/16/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,This is one the best place in Melbourne where you can eat the very Australian BREAKFAST!!!
168,O W.,11/07/2015,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,I love this spot. Fabulously creative and tasty dishes whether it's lunch or breakfast. The chocolates and other items for sale are fantastic for gifts. Slick well trained staff. My daily coffee stop
169,Jane Q.,11/09/2015,"Murrumbeena, Australia",2 star rating,"The bread tastes too salt, iced green tea too sweet, doesn't feel like original taste of green tea. Ordered the lobster brunch as well as spring chicken, Iced green tea and iced mocha. None is favorite. btw, waiting outside for around 40 minutes really annoying, do disappoint after trying the food."
170,Juliana K.,9/19/2012,"Perth, Australia",4 star rating,"Wow just wow, what a gorgeous little breakfast and brunch spot.After waiting some time for our table I ordered the deconstructed cheesecake on Brioche with Grand Marnier oranges. The staff were really attentive and the food came out quickly. The meal was beyond grand, and well worth the wait.It's places like this that make me think I could put up with Melbourne's crumby weather just so I could feast at these kinds of cafes. On that note, the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not five is because a lot of seating is outside and there's no heaters. It was cold."
171,Irene C.,10/23/2011,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"A week or so ago after a night out on the town, my partner and I decided to head to 'The Hardware Societe' for breakfast. It was a small little shop that was actually pretty hard to find considering it wasn't really around anything, and that we were expecting a much grander shopfront.  To start, hot chocolate. It arrives looking like a tea set, a mug(with chocolate paste inside), a jug with hot frothy milk, and another jug with extra chocolate sauce. It takes up quite a bit of space on the already tiny round tables, but hey- you get around 3 cup-fulls worth of refills. The menu is a little hard to get your head around if your not a morning person, baked eggs and chorizos, duck confit(yes this is the breakfast menu), croque madame. Now I was set on my meal, my partner however was lost. They did not have bacon, yes that's right- no bacon on the menu whatsoever. Not a problem for me, but my partner who drank into the night was in need of a hangover cure.If your just after your average bacon, eggs and toast breaky, I probably wouldn't recommend this place. Now if your after something a little different, my baked eggs and chorizos was an absolute delight. Steaming hot, right out of the oven served in a cute tiny pot on a chopping board, with herb bread on the side, it was like dippy eggs and soldiers on crack(in a good way of course).Overall I found this place quite pleasant, the staff were helpful, and the prices were about right. My only downside would be the size, the shop was very compact and everyone wanted a piece of it(even for a 9am Sunday). I would not consider going with a large group of people, as the table can become squashy and uncomfortable.Nonetheless, this dish was exceptional, I will 100% return in the future to eat the same thing once again."
172,Abel C.,2/07/2013,"Adelaide, Australia",1 star rating,"This is pretentious over priced averageness. $19 bucks for some 15cm section of dry baguette with half a rasher of bacon, handful of baby spinach and some chutney which was tasty. And then just some standard scrambled eggs with parsley in it, kinda nice but not special.But seriously the bread was dry as and the portions are super skimpy. Don't go here unless your just going for the hipster vibe. As far as I am concerned it is just over priced pretentious food. I could have got better from some random dodgy joes cafe.When I told the staff I was not happy they didnt even care or offer anything. Plus to top off their exorbitant prices they dont have credit or debit card facilities, I mean this guy is already extracting a crazy profit margin and probably dodging tax too. I mean its the 21st century and you dont accept credit. The sad thing is lots of people buy this rubbish regardless because it feels hipster. It didnt taste any better than my local chain coffee store breakfast.My advice to them, reduce the unnecessary amount of staff you have running around and start giving people decent food. At least fresh bread and 2 rashers of bacon not 0.5 a rasher... come on!!!"
173,Megan L.,6/11/2015,"West Sacramento, CA",4 star rating,"Great for all day breakfast, arrive early on the weekend but expect to still wait 15-20 min. Soy chai latte was great but next I'd try the hot chocolate, everyone seemed to have one! Food is a bit heavy and filling, croquet Madame was amazing. A must try."
174,Jean L.,4/28/2016,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,Lobster Benedict nice. Good mix of flavor. Only disappointment was tiny cup of latte.
175,Leah B.,11/23/2015,"Brisbane, Australia",4 star rating,"Delish brekky in a cosy spot - hidden away a bit but worth the find. Well priced, heaps of options presented on a clipboard menu and great coffee. Loved the vibe and whilst busy, only had to wait 5-10 mins after putting our names down on a Sunday morning. It's cosy (read tigh squeeze) but worked well as a couple. Thumbs up."
176,Joanne P.,10/04/2011,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"It is very easy to walk past this café without giving it a second glance. The yellow ""Café"" sign is the only indication of the surprises within; that is unless you visit on a weekend when the crowds gathered around the store front capture your interest. This tiny French/Spanish inspired café has both quirky décor and staff which makes it charming and is backed up by the delicious food. Seated around a large communal wooden table gave me the chance to check out other diners food and the teapot cozies that added to the atmosphere. I went for the poached eggs with pear hollandaise, tomato and jamon, which was a delicious and surprisingly subtle twist on a classic. Yum! If nothing else don't go past the hot chocolate, which is made with real chocolate that melts at the bottom of the pot and gives you one last chocolate hit. Yes. There is just so much right with this place. The only challenge is making sure you don't miss out as Hardware Societe closes at 2pm on weekends, It is worth getting up early for!"
177,Josh K.,6/11/2013,"St Kilda, Australia",1 star rating,"Without a doubt, one of the worst coffees I've ever had in my life. I have, honestly, had better coffee from airport transit lounges than this place.I'm told their food is good but I didn't get that far. The coffee was enough to make me never want to eat there again. There are plenty other opportunities in Melbourne."
178,Mel P.,1/03/2013,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"Great brunch spots are not as easy to come by in the CBD as they are in the inner suburbs. Most cafes in this half of the city shut down for the weekend, which means Hardware Societe is always brimming with people. By 10am, there's a steady crowd of eager diners for their delicious fare. I've also taken Mum for lunch the week and she has raved about it ever since. A great little gem."
179,Kristin S.,7/24/2013,Australia,4 star rating,"It's busy busy busy! Waited about 40 mins on a Sunday morning to bag a table for 2. I didn't mind cause it gave me plenty of time to catch up with my breakfast buddy.Hot Chocolate is a must order! It's not any ordinary hot choc. It comes with steamed milk on the side and in your mug you get what I think is a scoop of chocolate mouse and cream.. mix it all together and it's the perfect cup of steaming chocolate goodness. Mmmmm.... And let's get to the main meal. After much deliberating stuck with the classic Baked Eggs with Chorizo and yep no regrets here either. Runny egg, spicy thick tomato sauce and crusty baguette to mop up all the goodness. Warm, hearty, perfect for winter breakfast! Sign me up!!"
180,Eliza B.,4/06/2013,"Sydney, Australia",3 star rating,"When I showed up to this packed eatery, it seemed like everyone was having scrambled eggs - maybe that's what all the buzz is about??After reading reviews here, Hardware had a lot to live up to. I'm a big fan of baked goods, French cooking, and breakfast, so I set aside a morning to indulge - and on a Thursday at 10 they were packed. But unfortunately the coconut banana bread (a sliced open mini banana loaf with a carmelized banana and mascarpone inside) was really just so so - too sweet for the flavors of the bread and bananas to pop out. The things on the menu are definitely quite fancy creations, but while everything is quite visually appealing and the ingredients are fresh and interesting (figs, various cheeses, mascarpone) what I had didnt really work as a dish. They do have Padre cafe here (which is awesome), but their chai latte was weak an watery."
181,Rebecca S.,5/31/2015,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,Ordered the salmon confit for brunch and it absolutely delicious! Service was decent however we were sat at a communal table and it felt a bit cramped being in the corner with not much space
182,Charlotte C.,11/23/2015,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,I highly recommend baked eggs. These are my favorite. They are always perfect.
183,Nick B.,5/03/2014,"Richmond, Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,This is a rare find in the CBD! A cafe that actually does a good breakfast and has a bit of character! The line of 20-30 people outside this small cafe on a Sunday morning suggests it's a winner and I couldn't agree more. I got in early (9am) on a Sunday and even this early had to go on a wait list to get in for a table of 2. It's was definitely worth the wait however. Me and my dining partner both had the fried eggs which come with thick cut bacon and polenta sitting on top of a delicious slice of bread. Such a simply thing but done so well. We were sat at a communal table with a young family which was really nice as we joined their conversation and they have us great suggestions on what to order. The group that sad down after them however not so friendly. The service was good (would have preferred my coffee a little quicker) with good coming out within 10 mins of ordering and coffee shortly after. The team there are really attentive and know their product well. I will keep coming back to this not so hidden gem in the CBD
184,Rachel B.,8/14/2015,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"My husband found this place for us to try out for brunch, and it did not disappoint! I had the vegetarian option baked eggs, and was EXTREMELY happy. It came with a side of baguette slices to dip. So good, I would love to try and replicate at home.  Will be back again when I'm in Melbourne!"
185,Erin O.,7/29/2017,"Merrimac, Australia",5 star rating,"Got in early on a Sunday morning and walked straight to a table, excellent weekend specials- worth a trip every weekend to try the different combos. Coffee is outstanding!"
186,David H.,8/30/2012,Australia,5 star rating,"Hardware Societe is a great place to go for a Sunday morning lazy breakfast in Melbourne! It captivates with French sophistication and charm, and a high quality dining experience.If you're looking for a restaurant that's able to offer something more than the usual brunch options, with a certain je ne sais quois, then Hardware Societe is the place for you!Any restaurant worthwhile in Melbourne may involve a table wait and I've gladly waited for 20 minutes for a table at Hardware Societe. Spectacular news is that Hardware Societe are now spreading out and have taken over the building next door. The revolution is spreading!The counter is a visual feast with brightly coloured tarts and macaroons, extraordinary brown chocolate creations, crème brulee and a host of amazing French sweets. Resistance is almost impossible!All eyes are on the white uniformed rock star chefs with awesome tattoos who perform wonders in the kitchen for all to see... Each dish has amazing flair and bathed in TLC. There is a French attention to detail!Hardware Societe offers some of Melbourne's favourite dishes such as Baked eggs served in a French pan with chunks of chorizo and cheese. This is a cacophony of taste and flavour! These kinds of dishes warm the stomach and leave you with a feeling of pleasantness for hours. Oo la la! But a recent menu change means the restaurant now offers another two great Baked egg options including Merguez sausage and almond pistou as well as amazing mushrooms with crème fraiche, gruyere and sage.After a big night out you may prefer the Banana bread with caramel and crushed nougat. Or Fried brioche with nutella, strawberries and toasted hazelnuts.Even the sourdough fruit toast is sensational, served in a pretty arrangement on a wooden board with an extraordinary amount of butter. And it comes with a cute butter knife...The quality of the food is undeniable. Everything is well cooked, great flavour profiles and the freshness (including the bread) stands out.Be impressed by the communal table and chic plastic chairs. Where space is at a premium they're functional but also can be fashionable."
187,Linh D.,7/24/2012,"Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"Despite having the street name in their restaurant name, I've never actually managed to make it here until last week.The staff were friendly and put up with my ""recently returned from America where people work hardddd for the tips"" mannerisms. (I basically chat more than any normal patron would).The food was also great, I had the chicken polenta thing and an iced chocolate. The ice chocolate would probably be the second best that I've had in Melbourne, but I think they gave me extra ice cream to silence my perkiness... The polenta was excellent, and the chicken bit of it was okay but overall it was really good.I can't wait to come back and check other things on the menu."
188,David M.,10/19/2012,Australia,4 star rating,"I originally set out to dine at Manchester Press but found The Hardware Sociéte instead. I do not blame it on the fact that I did not know where I was going since I was armed not only with my trusty Samsung Galaxy S2 and Google Maps, but because I am a man and I never get lost. Perhaps I should ask Germaine Greer's opinion on that statement.What I originally thought was going to turn out to be on the scale of The European, but just closer to Southbank, turned out to be quite an interesting café on Hardware Street. I was looking forward to something rich, French and bold, like Brigitte Bardot. However what I found was a laneway café with a queue and a highly visible sign that says that they only accept cash. Knowing that there was a wait, I played Marco Polo until I found an ATM. I never carry cash as I just spend it so this relationship was already starting on a sour note.I returned to The Hardware Sociéte and the hostess was shouting my name down the laneway. It was perfect timing as I was coming back with a fistful of sweaty bank notes and I was quite hungry. The table was ready.We were seated at a communal table. I felt like poor little possessed Regan in The Exorcist when Father Karras first visited her. I really do not like waiting, not being able to pay with a credit card or communal tables for that matter. Trying to keep an open mind, I found the atmosphere to be very energetic as we were seated at a rather round classic French white table where there was enough room so you are not left to intrude into the lives of others, so it was not a big deal in the end.There was no wine list per se, but a drinks list. I really, and I mean REALLY, wanted some wine, however settled for a Kronenbourg mainly because it was so inexpensive. The peppy server informed us of the two specials, being seared tuna on a bed of potato salad, beans and poached eggs and also a brioche. Having not eaten anything substantial for about a day, I decided to order both.I was very impressed with the tuna special. The complimentary tastes, the slightly seared tuna, the colours and the presentation just really floored me as I was not expecting something so good. I really do not order many ""desserts"" since I am trying to keep my boyish figure from the bygone era of Hanson, but when I first saw and then tasted the brioche with strawberry jam and fresh cherries, my reaction was pure and utter blasphemy, just like how little Regan reacted to Father Karras. Unbelievably good and I was vocal about it. Stuff gluttony! I just wanted more and I don't mean just another cheap Kronenbourg.The service was very attentive and articulate. The ""vibe"" was pretty good and it seems like a fair amount of locals dine here. Given that the food is excellent, I thought it was great value for money and I will certainly be returning with another sweaty hand full of cash. Despite the fact that they do not take credit cards and you will most likely have to queue, the rewards are worth the inconvenience."
189,Scott M.,5/26/2012,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"My wife and I do love our weekend breakfast adventures in Melbourne, and we were ready to try somewhere new.  I took a look at the Yelposphere and there seemed to be a general consensus that Hardware Societe was worth trying.And it was.  We timed it JUST right, about a 10 minute wait, but we noticed quite a huge queue waiting to get in before the 1400 cut-off when we were finishing up.The important bits, for those of you who want just the facts:Cappuccino:  Outstanding.  Perfect temperature.  Infinitely drinkable.  Breakfast:  YUM.  We both had the same thing, the baked eggs with chorizo, Roma tomatoes, and other yummy stuff.  As my wife put it: ""I was sad when I ate my last piece of chorizo""...I also went so far as to trying the Syphon coffee.  Never had one of those before, but have to say that it, too, was superb.  The baristas look serious and clearly take their coffee very seriously.  If we had to think of a downside, it would be in only two areas:1)  A sense of being rushed.  We had JUST sat down and someone appeared telling us about the specials.  No more than a minute later and they were back asking for our order (having never been here before, we hadn't even finished reading the menu).2)  Seating.  It's popular, very popular, and if you don't like ""family style"" sharing at a big table, you may find yourself eating amongst strangers.  I'm not a fan of this, but, at least my wife and I got the corner and we had an illusion of privacy...but, not much.The food was fantastic, the staff generally very attentive, and I think that if you can time it just right so you don't feel squished in, it could really carry off the French cafe feel that they're clearly aiming for.Oh, be sure to bring cash - the menu said no credit and no EFTPOS...glad we happened to have just the right amount."
190,Laur H.,9/19/2012,Australia,4 star rating,"If you are after a good coffee in Melbourne, Lygon St, Degraves Laneway or Hardware Lane are good places to start.Last year I worked next to this place for 12 months, and I am pretty sure I kept their business afloat by buying coffee. The staff here are incredibly friendly, despite the queue out the door at all times, and your coffee is served with a tiny donut on the lid, just because. What more is there to say?"

The greatest thinghere is that you don't have to play an urban sports of sorts byducking weaving, dodging, diving, ignoring, and running fromthe countless individuals whom accost you to dine in atwhich ever establishment they happen to be awkwardly postedoutside of.Long queues provide good discussion time, and come winterthis place is very cosy. well executed wines (from memory)and some great food too. Good coffee, and best of all theyhave that awesome sugar that looks like breadcrumbs-gosh it good. Its uber popular because it just focuses on whatit is- a eatery, doing food well, and design, and everything elseIts biggest saving grace is that there is the lack of peopletrying to convince you to dine in- it's simply not needed. I have been numerous times, alas not lately"
192,Hhh S.,3/05/2017,"Melbourne, Australia",3 star rating,"food was ok, was expecting a higher standard as this is a hyped up place. very long wait line and my friends dish was absolutely disgusting. I'll go elsewhere for a more appetising meal."

197,Paul W.,11/19/2013,"Brisbane, Australia",5 star rating,"We had to try the Hardware Societe while in Melbourne. As it was a Sunday morning there was a line of people waiting outside. We were told our wait would be 25mins which turned out to be very accurate. The food, drinks and service were all excellent! I had the signature Chorizo which is well worth a try. Definitely will come back even if the wait is half an hour or more. It's worth the wait!!!"
198,Wendy N.,12/18/2011,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"I've only been here for lunch, but I definitely liked what I saw - good food made from obviously quality ingredients, the cute decor, friendly staff, and good coffee. The lunch menu only had very limited vegetarian options both times I went - but the quiche was so good the first time around that I was more than happy to have that again.I will definitely return to try the brunch that everyone raves on about! I just have to wake up early enough to avoid the inevitable long wait...."
199,Rose K.,2/06/2015,"Sydney, Australia",4 star rating,"The Salmon, duck and chicken was absolutely delicious. The service was good too. Highly recommended."
200,Meeko P.,3/13/2012,"Bay Village, OH",5 star rating,"Tiny place tucked away down a small street. Great breakfast and service. I had the Chorizo, Peas and Eggs casserole, served with toasted, sliced, sourdough baguette drizzled with olive oil. Simply one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. Other menu Items look great, made it hard to decide, Can't wait to go back."
201,Zag Z.,8/03/2014,"East Brisbane, Australia",2 star rating,Breakfast a but to much for me- too much brioche /chai sauce/ sugary donuts!! Busy as well. Staff were lovely. Coffee ok
202,Lynn M.,8/06/2013,Australia,5 star rating,"I want to roll up in a doona made from bread and eggs from The Hardware Societe. I went out on a limb and took 9 girlfriends here after a pretty serious hen night purely based on yelps reviews. My heart began to beat pretty fast when I turned the corner and saw what seemed to be a large crowd of people waiting for a table for breakfast. When my crew turned around and prepared to give me the 'I will kill you' stare I started to worry.The lovely lady at front of house took our details, gave us an honest waiting time and kindly let us all order take-away coffees to keep us warm whilst we waited.We were all seated withing 30 minutes together and ordered more coffee. I couldn't resist when I saw the varieties of drip and pour coffees that they offer.Their breakfast menu is small but definitely not simple. They have a variety of sweet and savory options including corn breads, baked eggs and many other mushroom and eggs deliciousness.Do not panic when you see a line outside, consider it a good thing!We left stuffed and energized and I felt safe once more among my hungover buddies."
203,Wes K.,3/26/2016,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"Excellently chic, pleasant, and small, ish. Had the baked eggs with chorizo and spinach: superb. In a neat little alley smack dab in the middle of the CBD. Had a really nice coffee as well. Would love to return and bring friends."
204,Art F.,8/31/2016,"Richmond, Australia",4 star rating,"Prepare to wait. Pretty nice food and nice ambiance though. But the queue out the door, even at non peak hours mid week, and it's still a long wait. They can't help being popular though. Good for them."
205,Emilie P.,7/07/2016,"Ville de Québec, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow wow wow! Best brekky ever! Cute place, kind people, outside tables with heaters so We could enjoy the little street and the Melbourne vibe while eating. Great coffee and aweeeesome food!"
206,Alex F.,4/12/2016,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,Eclectic mix of French and Mexican inspired brunch. Was the highlight of our breakfasts in Melbourne with great staff to boot!
207,Kathryn B.,6/11/2013,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"I thought I was eating some good food in Melbourne and then I came here.  The first sign that this was different was the long line early on a Sunday for brunch. We had seen some lines as well but nothing like this.  We left our name on the doily of the hostess, ran down the corner for a coffee, and came back to wait.  Our name was quickly called and we were sat at the bar around the kitchen.  This gave us prime viewing of all the delicious-looking fare coming out of the kitchen and some inside knowledge of the menu.  After careful consideration I ordered the fried eggs (jamn, figs, manchego, and toast) and my partner ordered the baked eggs (sausage, toast, beans). We were both immensely pleased with our orders and polished them off slowly while watching the chefs at work. The perfect mouthful of jamon, eggs, fig and manchego on toast was just such a new and wonderful experience. There was even a little jam on the toast that was like icing on the cake. My beautiful hot chocolate washed it all down perfectly.  I got one bite of my partners beans which were a spiced chickpea that paired wonderfully with his sausage.  So good. My partner loved his long black.Make the time to stand in this line and eat brunch here. I know I'll be back."
208,Allan B.,10/16/2011,"Windermere, FL",4 star rating,"Well Hardware Lane is an interesting place, to be sure. It's tiny, and feels like a street in Rome with all the barkers from the restaurants trying to convince you to try their food.Up at the far north end, there's a little place that you might easily miss since it is only open for breakfast and lunch. Go at these times though, and you'll see a small crowd formed, eagerly awaiting one of their few (8 I think) tables to open up. Coffees are spectacular here (as they are in most of Melbourne's better brekkie spots), as are the teas.  The best food, in my opinion, is the baked eggs dish with chorizo, peas and tomatos. It's almost like a rich, egg-based paella, in a little iron pot. Comes with some seriously good toast, which makes for a great 'spoon' to use in the eggs.Get there early, or fight the crowd for a table!"
209,Olivia H.,5/08/2013,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"Hardware society was a hit and miss. Maybe I had high expectations from all the great reviews but in my opinion, it is good BUT pretty overrated. The food was okayyy (but was on a good side), but anyway, its one of those restaurants that you have to try if you're in Melbourne. Advice: Come in as early as you can or you have to wait for more than 30mins.I ordered the Chorizo baked eggs and it was delish!! Just the right amount of flavor and mix. My hubbie ordered one of their sausages but it was just so-so... More mexican than french for the sausages. Great food presentation and their portion is more on the smaller side, understandable though since it's french cuisine anyways. Their coffee's not that great but their ice chocolate drink was delish! Shall order their hot chocolate next time. Their service was awesome. Waiter/waitress is really friendly.  Overall, will come back to try their lunch menus next time.BEWARE: CASH ONLY."
